When there's a fervent appreciation for a subject (at least food/drink space), the &lt;strong&gt;more-engaged experts almost &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to delve behind the scenes&lt;/strong&gt; to study what separates good brews from bad; to understand the parameters that go into what they're &quot;appreciating.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You don't have to be a literal &quot;brewer/craftsman&quot; to have an implicit interest in the subject.&lt;/strong&gt; Many of the beer enthusiasts here are curious about the craft &amp;mdash; you almost &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to, to appreciate the subject &amp;mdash; and that's why they are asking about it here. And of course the craftsmen need to know what makes a good beer &lt;strong&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/strong&gt; so there's a lot of cross-cultural interests here, whether you an actual, literal &quot;home brewer&quot; not. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It simply makes sense to combine these subjects. While the brewers and consumers are not physically the same exact audience, they &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; largely seem to have the same range of interests&amp;hellip; and questions. Essentially, the scope of these two sites overlap considerably; much more than I would have anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/LtPf9.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Put them back together.

This of course applies to &lt;a href=&quot;http://superuser.com/&quot;&gt;Super User&lt;/a&gt; as well. And Stack Overflow itself continuously evolves! Hence a never-ending stream of questions at &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.stackoverflow.com/&quot;&gt;Meta&lt;/a&gt;.

One last interesting example is &lt;a href=&quot;http://english.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;English Language &amp;amp; Usage&lt;/a&gt;, where both language and its more rapidly changing context give rise to new questions like &lt;a href=&quot;http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/148323/is-there-a-non-sexual-phrase-for-sleeping-with-someone&quot;&gt;&quot;Is there a non-sexual phrase for sleeping with someone?&quot;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;...or the subject is huge (whether in breadth or depth)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, there are sites whose underlying subjects &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; necessarily evolve (or at least not very fast), &lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://history.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;History&lt;/a&gt;. But the sheer size and/or intricacy of the subject lends it sustained opportunities for exploration—delving in to find genuinely new and interesting questions. Though sites like &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathematica.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;Mathematica&lt;/a&gt; are bound to a (mostly) set language, from the (at least, seemingly) unlimited power of the language arises a huge domain of applications that users are continuously exploring, &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; surprised by the discovery of new challenges, new workarounds, and new techniques.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I ask,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;What kinds of questions will keep Beer.SE alive?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have a preliminary opinion in mind, but one I don't feel qualified to develop into a full-fledged answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It just doesn't feel to me that Beer has as rich a history as, well, History itself, nor does it appear to lend itself to &quot;new applications&quot; and &quot;ways.&quot; Once we exhaust &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.beer.stackexchange.com/questions/8/should-general-questions-about-beer-be-made-more-specific&quot;&gt;general questions&lt;/a&gt; about classifications of beer, bottling and distribution, temperature and skunking, and such, it seems fathomable we might even get through the histories of most classes of beers, techniques for tasting and pairing beers... and then what? &lt;strong&gt;All these subjects are ones which neither evolve nor introduce any great breadth or depth to be explored.&lt;/strong&gt; So what part of Beer &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; have these qualities, for generating new questions?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To me (and &lt;a href=&quot;http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/13493397#13493397&quot;&gt;others too, maybe&lt;/a&gt;), it seems one of the only evolving aspects of beer we &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; latch onto, is specific beers and breweries. And putting such in the context of regions, too, would greatly expand what can be asked, and the specificity (and usefulness) of answers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think the usual culture against brand-specific questions and answers on SE, is understandable regarding, say, technology, where products and websites are often ephemeral, and more general answers would help direct future visitors toward the specific answers they need.

As noted, cider is closer to wine in production. As such, the questions and discussions of brewing techniques/technology will be less relevant to the those looking for cider information. There could also be less chance that people could usefully contributed to beer discussions if they are primarily interested in cider. It seems like cider would be too off-topic in this case since the motivation is the underlying production. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2) Consider the user base. Cider and beer are, right or wrong, frequently grouped together for sales, at parties, at bars, etc. One reason for this might be the placement of cider on taps. The real issue, however, is that since these two products are seen as very similar by consumers, this site could include cider as on-topic, drawing a greater audience, even if some of the discussion would be technically different from the beer discussions. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure I've got a great argument for one against the other.

These can include making a honey-wine or even distilled into a liquor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I think it would be on a case by case basis that you would determine if this was off topic or not.

I felt that such questions, asked with no &quot;skin in the game,&quot; would necessarily be of low(er) quality, because we don't tend to think things through as much when we're not &lt;em&gt;personally&lt;/em&gt; involved.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, I'm currently in San Diego but originally from New York City and visit family and friends there often, so when asking about NYC, I have some vested interest in getting &lt;em&gt;useful&lt;/em&gt; answers, and care more about specificity, &lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt; I don't necessarily want to know about breweries inaccessible by NYC's public transportation system, since I almost never have a car while there. Such considerations would not enter my mind were I asking about, for example, Austin, TX, a place I've never been and don't have any current plans to visit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, I propose that, &lt;strong&gt;while we &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; feel comfortable asking questions about brands and regions, we should ask &quot;responsibly,&quot; &lt;em&gt;i.e.&lt;/em&gt; ask questions we earnestly imagine ourselves &lt;em&gt;making use of&lt;/em&gt; in an upcoming trip or encounter—questions that benefit us &lt;em&gt;personally&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Feel free to link this meta post when asking regional questions, as a &quot;disclaimer.&quot; That's why I'm writing it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="73" LastActivityDate="2014-04-11T17:00:40.970" Title="Asking brand-specific / regional questions &quot;responsibly&quot;" Tags="&lt;discussion&gt;" AnswerCount="1" CommentCount="0" />

Today we're showing fewer than 100 visits/day.  The obvious effect is that with lower activity people don't need to come around as much (nothing new to read/answer).  But there's a less-obvious effect, possibly more important than that: lower activity increases the perception that the site will close, and if the site is going to close there's not much incentive to work to improve it (effort spent on posts will be lost, at least for most of them -- nowhere to migrate).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So not only do we need to figure out how to increase activity, but we need to do it before too many potential contributors wander away.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If this site is to exist alongside Homebrewing, I wonder if we should broaden the scope to wine, cider, and mead.  Homebrewing is about &lt;em&gt;making&lt;/em&gt; these beverages and maybe this site should be about &lt;em&gt;consuming&lt;/em&gt; them -- all of them, not just beer.  (We would need to adjust the site's name in that case.)  Because this site was created it seems like there's a place for questions that are about beer but not about &lt;em&gt;making&lt;/em&gt; beer; that's presumably just as true for wine et al.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(I was not involved in the Area 51 proposal for this site and I don't participate on Homebrewing.
