To do that they do take on a variety of topics around the beer industry, tasting, ingredients etc.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, the scope of this site is broader and more expansive. It includes large scale production, excludes super small scale production and generally is more focused on the *consumption* of beer rather than production.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Audience**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is where the real differences lie. While there is likely *a good bit* of audience overlap (probably all homebrewers are beer drinkers), Home brewers are a *subset* of all beer drinkers. This site is intended to appeal to the superset of beer drinkers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Conclusion**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The only real issue here is the ordering of the site's beginnings. Typically how site parentage would work would be that the larger audience site would be the first, and then the separate interest group would splinter. In this case the separate interest group already has their own site with their own question set.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are a couple of interesting questions here on meta that address this further: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - http://meta.beer.stackexchange.com/questions/1/is-homebrewing-on-topic&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - http://meta.beer.stackexchange.com/questions/4/what-should-we-do-when-a-question-already-has-an-answer-on-the-homebrewing-site&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And lastly, I'd like to point back to an instance where I had many of the same thoughts I've seen re: homebrewing with another set of sites that I was involved in. The Sport.SE/Fitness.se meta crisis.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - [Sport.se and Fitness.se should be combined](http://meta.sports.stackexchange.com/q/96/6)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Shog set me straight here, and I've come to see his way of thinking about these things. It's worth a look back at what was said there to inform any future discussions here." />

One last interesting example is [English Language &amp;amp; Usage](http://english.stackexchange.com/), where both language and its more rapidly changing context give rise to new questions like [&quot;Is there a non-sexual phrase for sleeping with someone?&quot;](http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/148323/is-there-a-non-sexual-phrase-for-sleeping-with-someone).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the other hand, there are sites whose underlying subjects _don't_ necessarily evolve (or evolve very fast), _e.g._ [History](http://history.stackexchange.com/). But the sheer size and/or intricacy of the subject lends it sustained opportunities for exploration—delving in to find genuinely new and interesting questions. Though sites like [Mathematica](http://mathematica.stackexchange.com/) are bound to a (mostly) set language, from the (at least, seemingly) unlimited power of the language arises a huge domain of applications that users are continuously exploring, _still_ surprised by the discovery of new challenges, new workarounds, and new techniques.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So I ask,&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### What kind of questions will keep Beer.SE alive?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;with a preliminary opninion in mind, but one I don't feel qualified to develop into an answer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It doesn't feel to me that Beer has as rich a history as, well, History itself, nor does it appear to lend itself to &quot;new applications&quot; and &quot;ways&quot;. Once we exhaust [general questions](http://meta.beer.stackexchange.com/questions/8/should-general-questions-about-beer-be-made-more-specific) about classifications of beer, serving temperatures, skunking, and such, it even seems fathomable that we might get through the large of histories of kinds of beers, as well as techniques for tasting and pairing beers, and then what? What part of Beer keeps evolving that will generate new questions?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To me (and [others too, maybe](http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/13493397#13493397)), it seems one of the only evolving aspects of beer we _can_ latch onto, is specific beers and breweries; and putting such in the context of regions, too, would greatly expand what can be asked, and the specificity (and usefulness) of answers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The culture against brands is understandable in, say, technology, where products and websites are often ephemeral, and more general answers would help direct future visitors toward the specific answers they need; and the culture against regional questions is understandable too, in that most communities don't want to end up with a hundred questions about the same thing, only differing in a seemingly arbitrary detail (location).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But I don't know if those cultures apply to Beer.SE. **Our very subject is embedded in products,** whereas for technology the subject is an abstraction away from products. And, **our &quot;problems&quot; regarding beer are sometimes _going_ to be regional**—finding beers to taste and exploring breweries seem like important activities for beer enthusiasts, activities necessarily tied to location.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What are your thoughts?" />

As noted, cider is closer to wine in production. As such, the questions and discussions of brewing techniques/technology will be less relevant to the those looking for cider information. There could also be less chance that people could usefully contributed to beer discussions if they are primarily interested in cider. It seems like cider would be too off-topic in this case since the motivation is the underlying production. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2) Consider the user base. Cider and beer are, right or wrong, frequently grouped together for sales, at parties, at bars, etc. One reason for this might be the placement of cider on taps. The real issue, however, is that since these two products are seen as very similar by consumers, this site could include cider as on-topic, drawing a greater audience, even if some of the discussion would be technically different from the beer discussions. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm not sure I've got a great argument for one against the other.

It is brewed using a fermenting process, and can include carbonation and hops.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, there are variations that perhaps would not fit. Since it gets is sugar from honey, it also overlaps with other honey produced products also termed mead. These can include making a honey-wine or even distilled into a liquor.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So I think it would be on a case by case basis that you would determine if this was off topic or not. For example, if it were in relation to making a Christmas mead which included some fruits and hops and was 8% abv then I think that would work, as opposed to questions about distilling honey to reach a 40% abv level.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Overall, since this exchange is so new, I think it is important to allow questions to come in and provide answers and just build content.

Beer can not be so narrow to fit all in topics in 212 questions. So the problem must be somewhere else.

I can no longer think of non-opinion-based questions to ask, and it seems most other people have run out too.  So, although beer is not a narrow topic, factual questions that don't fit under homebrewing.SE may be.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think the best answer might be to try to encourage more regional answers (which we decided were allowed in the above linked question).  Unfortunately, we might not have the critical mass for that to work: if someone asks where to get beer X near Milwaukee, but no one from Milwaukee uses this site, it likely becomes a dead question." />

Today we're showing fewer than 100 visits/day.  The obvious effect is that with lower activity people don't need to come around as much (nothing new to read/answer).  But there's a less-obvious effect, possibly more important than that: lower activity increases the perception that the site will close, and if the site is going to close there's not much incentive to work to improve it (effort spent on posts will be lost, at least for most of them -- nowhere to migrate).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So not only do we need to figure out how to increase activity, but we need to do it before too many potential contributors wander away.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If this site is to exist alongside Homebrewing, I wonder if we should broaden the scope to wine, cider, and mead.  Homebrewing is about *making* these beverages and maybe this site should be about *consuming* them -- all of them, not just beer.  (We would need to adjust the site's name in that case.)  Because this site was created it seems like there's a place for questions that are about beer but not about *making* beer; that's presumably just as true for wine et al.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(I was not involved in the Area 51 proposal for this site and I don't participate on Homebrewing.
