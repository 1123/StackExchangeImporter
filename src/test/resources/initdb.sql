Using (as pictured on the site) one 1.25" cube, or 20cc (40g) of rock per 1 bottle of 500cc of beer, you get 1:50 ratio (40J/K to 2000J/K), frozen to -60C would bring the glass merely from 20 to 18C.', 130);

Fermentation by ale yeasts at these relatively warmer temperatures produces a beer high in esters, which many regard as a distinctive character of ale beers. </p>

At these temperatures, lager yeasts grow less rapidly than ale yeasts, and with less surface foam they tend to settle out to the bottom of the fermenter as fermentation nears completion.

<p>Force carbonation - This is where CO2 is forced into the fermented beer. Because of the pressure (and the temperature at which it is done) the CO2 will dissolve into the beer solution. The fizz that happens when you open a beer is the CO2 coming out of solution. (Technically you can re-carbonate flat beer!)</p>

<p>Natural carbonation - All beer has SOME yeast present. Home-brewers that bottle will actually pour a little bit of sugar into the racked beer before bottling. The yeast that is present will re-activate and eat the sugar. One of the bi-products is CO2. Because the beer is bottled and the CO2 has nowhere to go, it will dissolve into solution. This is why you will often see little yeast cakes in the bottom of home-brewer''s bottles.</p>

<p>TL;DR - Temperature, methods of carbonating, storing beer can all affect carbonation. </p>

<p>One theory begins in 1722 when Ralph Harwood, a London brewer, created a beer called <em>Entire</em>.  For some time, working folk had been drinking a blend of beer, ale, and strong beer, which pubs would mix to balance out their stocks and maintain acceptable flavor.  </p>

<p><em>Entire</em> was a pre-mixed version, brewed by Hardwood then sold and delivered to pubs.  Prior to this point, each pub had mixed their own.  In addition to economies of scale, Harwood''s method allowed for aging of the finished product.  Historians theorize that the name <em>porter</em> came about because of the porters who worked at the markets and delivered the final product to the pubs.  A variation of this theory suggests that <em>porter</em> simply refers to the working class occupations of those who drank the concoction.</p>

<p>Another theory suggests that <em>porter</em> comes from the Netherlands, where a beer called <em>poorter</em> was being made as early as the 1300s.  The Dutch were prolific traders, and cultural transfer could easily have occurred.  The term <em>poorter</em> originally concerned inhabitants of walled cities and may also have been related to social station.</p>

Some beer "purists" regard the process as being unnatural because it really messes with the flavor of the beer. An example of a beer that uses Nitro is Guinness. When you open a can of Guinness, a nitrogen "ball" activates to carbonate the beer.</p>

<p>Personally, I think that the traditional names for beer styles (stout, lager, IPA, wheat beer, etc.) are based a lot on brewing process, and in the case of something like lager or wheat beer, the name clearly shows the brewing origin. However, more and more brewers are pushing the boundaries of these styles, so when it comes to things like appearance and flavour, which are ultimately the things that matter, two beers from different brewing styles can be quite similar, or two beers from the same brewing style can be quite different.</p>

<p>In normal beer, the only sugar which enters the brewing process is from the malted barley: maltose and glucose released by the breakdown of starch, and a little sucrose and fructose. This <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2050-0416.1953.tb02720.x/abstract">1953 analysis by a chemist in the Carlsberg research laboratory</a> has all the gory details.</p>

<p>Normal brewing yeast has enzymes that break down glucose and fructose, <a href="http://www.madsci.org/posts/archives/2005-11/1132509463.Cb.r.html">but not lactose</a>. This kind of yeast evolved on rotting fruit, where there is plenty of sucrose, glucose, and fructose, but no lactose, so they never needed the enzymes. There are <a href="http://homedistiller.org/sugar/wash-sugar/lactose">other yeasts which can ferment lactose</a>, but they aren''t used in brewing, except by zany vodka makers and Mongols.</p>

<p>So, in a normal beer, potentially all of the sugar can be broken down during brewing. Whether it is or not is up to the brewer, who can stop the process while sugar remains, or let it run to completion. However, in a milk stout, there is no way for the lactose to be broken down, so it all remains at the end.</p>

<p>The amount of lactose in a milk stout varies, but it seems that it is likely to be in the range of <a href="https://byo.com/stories/item/1155-milk-stout-it-does-a-body-good">5 to 13%</a>; that is, in a (568 millilitre) pint, there may be anywhere from 28 to 74 grams of lactose. The lactose concentration in milk is about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactose_content_of_foods">4%</a>, so this is the equivalent of 700 - 1850 millilitres of milk. Rather a lot!</p>

INSERT INTO post VALUES (136, NULL, NULL, '<p>This is a broad question, notably regarding the differences between IPAs and Double IPAs, but here''s an overview focusing on the naming (and misconceptions thereof) and brewing of variants.</p>

<h3>Double IPA vs. Imperial IPA (IIPA)</h3>

<p>First, the Double IPA is also known as an Imperial IPA (IIPA). You can think of the "double" as referring to the two letter I''s :-) but the name actually owes itself to the beer having "double" the strength / hops.</p>

<h3>IPA vs. Double IPA</h3>

<p>The Double IPA generally uses more hops (though not literally "double"), lengthier brewing processes (<em>e.g.</em> Dogfish Head''s 90 Minute IPA, which is boiled for longer than its 60 Minute variant), sometimes secondary fermentation, etc. It has higher alcohol content, IPAs stopping around 7.5% ABV, while Double IPAs can soar to above 10%.</p>

<p>Double IPAs are claimed to have been started by the owner of the Russian River Brewing Company, famed for its flagship brew, Pliny the Elder, a Double IPA itself.</p>

<h3>American Pale Ale (APA) vs. American IPA</h3>

<p>The APA and American IPA are <em>not</em> synonymous. American Pale Ales are a derivative of (regular) British Pale Ales, deriving their own flavor from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hop_varieties#American" rel="nofollow">American hops</a>, <em>e.g.</em> Sierra Nevada''s Pale Ale. American IPAs, meanwhile, are, of course, derived from actual (British) IPAs, and possess greater bitterness and higher alcohol content—examples include Sierra Nevada''s Celebration Ale and Dogfish Head''s 60 Minute IPA. The line between APAs and IPAs blur (as do between many variants of ales), but categorically speaking, APAs are not IPAs.</p>

<h3>IPA vs. Black IPA</h3>

<p>The black IPA (also known by American Black Ale—and yes, a subset of the American IPA) uses dark roasted malts (used in porters and stouts) to achieve the color, while preserving hops characteristics. Some consider the black IPA more of a hoppy porter instead—and don''t believe the style will be formally recognized (<em>e.g.</em> by the Brewers Association).</p>

<p>As <a href="http://www.professorbeer.com/articles/skunked_beer.html">explained by George de Piro</a>, a biochemist and Brewmaster of C. H. Evans Brewing Company—</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When light hits beer, it provides the energy necessary to drive a reaction that transforms the iso-alpha-acids into 3-methyl-2-butene-1-thiol. The “thiol” part of that somewhat cumbersome name indicates that there is sulfur present. Sulfur compounds often have strong, offensive aromas. Some musteline animals, like skunks, have evolved the ability to produce this chemical, and use it for self-defense. [...] <strong>This photochemical reaction is the only cause of skunked beer. Warm storage, while damaging to the flavor of beer, does not skunk it.</strong> Cycling the temperature of beer from warm to cold and back again is also not implicated. Storing beer in the dark is the simple way to prevent skunking.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It''s actually pretty amazing how quickly this reaction can happen! From the same article,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The photochemical reaction that skunks beer occurs very quickly; a well-hopped beer in clear glass can become noticeably offensive with just 30 seconds of exposure to sunshine. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>To wrap it up,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since light is an essential ingredient in the skunking process, beers packaged in kegs, cans, and opaque bottles cannot be skunked.</p>

<p>Fractional freezing -- "jacking" in old parlance -- has a long history in the United States. The beverage applejack was produced using this method by first fermenting apple juice into hard apple cider. Then barrels of this cider were left outside during the winter and the connoisseur would occasionally fish out the frozen chunks of water, leaving an ever-concentrated batch of hard alcohol behind. At some point in the 20-25 percent ABV range, the liquor would stop freezing at ambient temperatures and the booze was ready to consume as "Jersey Lightning." It was also used as currency.</p>

<p>Moving into the malt-beverage world, brewers in Germany use fractional freezing to make eisbock. These brews are usually just regular bock beers, which clock in at 6 percent ABV, freeze-concentrated to something in the 13 percent ABV range. Frankly, there are probably easier ways to get high-proof beers (make a barleywine, for example) than by starting with a mid-strength one and concentrating it, but there''s a market for eisbocks and it''s possible to find them in the US as well. A more infamous set of freeze-concentrated beers was made by the Scottish brewery BrewDog in their quest to make "the strongest beer in the world." The first was Tactical Nuclear Penguin, a beer that started with an ABV in the teens and ended at 32 percent ABV. Then a little brewing war started up between BrewDog and German brewery Schorschbräu to make ever-stronger beers. Schorschbräu made a Schorschbock at 40 percent ABV, BrewDog countered with Sink the Bismarck at 41 percent ABV. Then came another beer at 55 percent ABV (that''s 110 proof, my friends). Schorschbräu is current record-holder with Schorschbock 57, at 57 percent ABV.</p>

<p>There are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hop_varieties" rel="nofollow">literally dozens of different varieties of hops,</a> in much the same way there are dozens of different breeds of dogs. Just as a Chihuaua and a Great Dane are both <em>Canis Lupus</em>, a Galena Hop and a Goldings Hop are bot <em>Humulus Lupulus</em>, separated by vastly different lineages and genetics. New hop varieties are often developed by selective crossbreeding of existing variants, to generate different flavor profiles by adjusting the acidity and oil content of the hop.</p>

<p>Like different breeds of dogs, different hop varieties are often the products of hundreds of years of genetic development in a particular climate -  the Pacific Northwest, especially the Yakima Valley and Cascade Mountains in Washington, Oregon and Idaho, is known for it''s production of very strong, highly acidic hops that impart a very strong bitter flavor - take a sip of a Sierra Nevada IPA and you''ll instantly recognize that classic blend of the ''three C''s''.</p>

<p>By contrast, traditional hops grown in England and on the European continent tend to be more mellow and aromatic - especially the so called ''noble hops'' popular in many less bitter tasting German and Czech beers. Still others, like Japans Sorachi Ace, offer a more citrus bite to the beer they''re added to. While these differences are not <em>directly</em> a product of climate, it''s doubtless true that climate has had an impact on the development of variation amongst the various hop lines that have been bred through the centuries -  and especially over the past 50 years or so.</p>

<p>Put another way: New World vs. Old World Hops is a meaningful distinction, but it has less to do with climate and more to do with the difference in cultivation practices and the specific varietals popular with farmers in various regions. Growing conditions may have some impact, but the specific lineage matters <em>much, much more</em>. The fact that those lineages tend to have significant geographic commonalities is as much an accident of history as it is of varying conditions, but it''s nonetheless sufficiently meaningful that, in particular referring to hops from the Pacific Northwest evokes a very specific and comprehensible flavor profile in most educated beer drinkers.</p>

<p>Letting alone ethanol, which triggers innumerable biochemical pathways in our bodies, hops itself <em>may</em> affect potency and sexual desire, in males at least, but there appears to be few clinical studies supporting this claim directly. Many articles online appear to have chained together several studies (or played news-telephone) to publish indirect conclusions, many of which oversimplify the effects of estrogen. For example, contrary to popular belief, it isn''t <em>testosterone</em> (alone) which masculinizes the male brain and behavior, but rather <em>its interaction with estrogen</em>, produced <em>from</em> testosterone through a process known as aromatization.<sup>1</sup> So it''s not as simple as more-estrogen-less-sex-drive.</p>

<p>I''m certainly not qualified to deliver conclusions myself, but I can at least point to some of the important studies from which current (mis)conceptions have derived.</p>

<p><sup>1: <a href="http://shahlab.ucsf.edu/papers/paper14.pdf" rel="nofollow">Wu, M. V. et al. Estrogen Masculinizes Neural Pathways and Sex-Specific Behaviors. 2009. [PDF]</a></sup></p>

<h2>Why some claim that hops decreases sex drive...</h2>

<p>Hops contains phytoestrogens,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>substances that promote estrogenic actions in mammals and structurally are similar to mammalian estrogen 17&beta;-estradiol (E<sub>2</sub>) [...]</p>
</blockquote>

<p><sup><a href="http://www.comilac.com.tr/uploads/pdf/22ComFUGA.pdf" rel="nofollow">Ososki, A. L. and Kennelly, E. J. Phytoestrogens: a Review of the Present State of Research. 2003. [PDF]</a></sup></p>

<p>Specifically,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>a recurring suggestion has been that hops have a powerful estrogenic activity and that beer may also be estrogenic. [...] We have identified a potent phytoestrogen in hops, 8-prenylnaringenin, which has an activity greater than other established plant estrogens.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><sup><a href="http://press.endocrine.org/doi/pdf/10.1210/jcem.84.6.5887" rel="nofollow">Milligan, S. R. et al. Identification of a potent phytoestrogen in hops (<em>Humulus lupulus</em> L.) and beer. 1999. [PDF]</a></sup></p>

<p>However, it''s worth noting that the same paper concludes,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[...] despite the high estrogenic activity of 8-prenylnarigenin, the total estrogenic activity of beer made using whole hops is still low [...] and no detrimental health effects due to "estrogens in beer" are to be expected.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anyway, another study led by the same researcher delved into the mechanism of action:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>8-Prenylnaringenin alone competed strongly with 17&beta;-estradiol for binding to both the &alpha;- and &beta;-estrogen receptors.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><sup><a href="http://press.endocrine.org/doi/pdf/10.1210/jcem.85.12.7168" rel="nofollow">Milligan, S. R. et al. The endocrine activities of 8-prenylnargingenin and related hop (<em>Humulus lupulus</em> L.) flavonoids. 2000. [PDF]</a></sup></p>

<p>(In case one is unfamiliar with how receptors work, receptors "catch" freestanding compounds in a medium such as the bloodstream, thereby reducing their effects. The phytoestrogen in hops appears to get itself "caught" by estrogen receptors, thereby blocking those receptors from catching estrogen it''d normally catch, thereby leaving higher levels of estrogen in the bloodstream.)</p>

<h2>...but it''s not that simple!</h2>

<p>Again, from these findings alone, conclusions about male potency and sex drive can''t be so easily drawn. Hormone interactions are sufficiently complex that researchers are still trying to untangle, isolate, and explain ever-more-specific biochemical pathways. Certainly the average Joe (or journalist) wouldn''t be capable of appreciating the magnitude (or triviality) of the effects of biochemical pathways described in researchers'' findings, much less draw definitive conclusions about physiological effects like "potency," "sex drive," and how it all affects, say, muscle-building. Not to mention all the other chemicals in play!</p>

<p>As a very example of the latter, one site [<a href="http://www.peaktestosterone.com/Testosterone_Beer.aspx" rel="nofollow">link</a>] (which, unfortunately, ranks high among Google search results) is clearly biased, grasping for evidence to "prove" that beer has detrimental effects on testosterone activity. I''m not saying beer <em>doesn''t</em>, but their article states that Xanthohumol, another compound found in hops, "blocks testosterone," when in fact <em>the very paper it cites</em> says (in its abstract nonetheless),</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Although hops is commonly linked with phytoestrogenic effects, we identified XN [Xanthohumol] as a pure estrogen antogonist. Interestingly, XN may also reduce the generation of estrogens by inhibition of the enzymatic activity of aromatase, which converts testosterone to estrogen. Anti-estrogenic effects of XN [...] were confirmed in vivo in an uterotrophy assay with prepubertal rats.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On top of all this, ethanol affects so many parts of the brain via so many chemical pathways—what''s even the significance of 8-prenylnarigenin or Xanthohumol when stacked against ethanol? Do you know?—I sure don''t—and probably no one does—else it''d have been stated by researchers themselves, without the "help" of attention-seeking bloggers and headline-hunting journalists.</p>

<h2>In conclusion,</h2>

<p>I''m not saying these blogs, articles, and threads are necessarily <em>wrong</em>—they might be right, whether right-by-chance, or right-by-empiricism (observation). What I <em>am</em> saying is that they can''t be <em>right-by-science</em>, as currently available research seems extremely domain-specific, incomplete in larger perspectives, and therefore not generalizable.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Addendum</h2>

<p>The study by Ososki and Kennelly also states</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As potential endocrine disrupters, phytoestrogens may act as antiestrogens and harm the reproductive health of males (Sharpe and Skakkebaek, 1993; Santti <em>et al.</em>, 1998). Reduced sperm quality, undescended testes and urogenital tract abnormalities were increased in the sons of mothers taking DES compared with those who did not take the miscarriage preventative drug [...]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This statement is initially misleading as it says "males" instead of "<em>developing</em> males"—a fact not made clear until the following sentence. From the studies it cites (emphasis mine),</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We argue that the increasing incidence of reproductive abnormalities in the human male may be related to increased oestrogen exposure <strong>in utero</strong>, and identify mechanisms by which this exposure could occur.</p>

INSERT INTO post VALUES (174, NULL, NULL, '<p>More than a millenia ago, there were few standardized recipies for herbs to add during the beer brewing process.

Traditionally it included plants such as yarrow, mugwort, henbane, sweet gale, bog rosemary, juniper, and more.  Some of these survive in gin recipes.</p>

<p>Why gruit has largely been replaced by hops is a fascinating and divisive historical question.  There may however have been a number of factors including the possibility (largely untested) that hops beers kept longer and the rising concern by Protestant (and even Catholic) nobles of the power of the economic power that this gave Catholic institutions.  What is known is that a campaign was waged against gruit and the purported (and likely actual) mind altering properties of it.  The use of gruit was more or less entirely supplanted by hops.</p>

<p>More recently some breweries have been experimenting with gruit beers for national pride and/or historical reasons.

<p>Fermentation of grain is universal, as is fermentation of fruit and honey. You find it in the new world with drinks like chicha (an Andean drink where saliva provides the amylase to break down corn starch into sugars for fermentation), among Native Americans in North America as well, in early Europe, in early China, and early Japan as well.</p>

<p>Grain fermenting is a remarkably complex process because yeast can''t digest starch so you have to have some way of turning starches into sugars.  These break down into more or less three strategies:</p>

<ol>
<li>malting (roasting sprouted grains).  Interestingly doesn''t work for rice.</li>
<li>helper cultures, like they use to make sake.  Add a fungus that breaks down starch and then a yeast to eat the sugar.  Indonesian "Tape" (rice or cassava "beer" or paste) is done this way as is Chinese rice beer and wine.  As a bonus this also works on other starches, like yams (used in Malaysia).</li>
<li>Chewing the grains to mix with saliva and then spitting in a bowl as with the Andean Chicha drink.</li>
</ol>

<p>South America has all three methods represented, as does early Asia.</p>

<p>The fact that different strategies are employed around the world suggests to my mind that brewing did not start somewhere and spread but was independently reinvented in different places.  It is probably for this reason extremely old, far older than we have direct evidence for.</p>

<p>As for beer, the question becomes what you mean.  If you mean fermented grains, we have no idea.  It''s very very old and might go back to neolithic times if not even earlier (though I suspect that the organized grain agriculture of neolithic times was an absolute prerequisite to grain fermentation).</p>

<p>If you mean malt, yeast, and hops, we still don''t know.  We have evidence that hops was cultivated for beer in Augustine''s time, and Old Norse distinguishes between beer and ale by the use of hops but Old English "beor" means something different (probably very strong mead with herbs?), suggesting perhaps that the hops distinction post-dated the split of Old Norse (and thus 8th century), but that doesn''t get you very far.  What is pretty clear is that it certainly predates our earliest records of the practice.  By how much and when did it become a separate drink?  I don''t think we will ever know.  At any rate the early prevalence of hops as one herb used in brewing among many in early England and Scandinavia suggests (though does not prove) that hops were adopted (again as one herb among any) for beer brewing by the Germanic tribes, some time before we have written records.</p>

<p>Now as for lager, these are far more recent.</p>

<p>Finally as a note, until maybe a hundred years ago, before modern capping and beer cans, most beer would have been sold uncarbonated, but speciality beers were carbonated much like champagne is today.  My own home brewing experiments (I even brew as a history nut) with non-carbonated beers suggest that they are of an altogether different character than carbonated ones (owing to the carbonic acid in carbonated drinks).  The flavors are lighter, sweeter, brighter, and more distinct, and entirely different than "flat" beer.  This is because dissolved carbon dioxide imparts extra acidity to beer.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:  It also occurs to me that controlled fermentation is one of the most common ways of preserving foods in the pre-industrial ages.  This includes lactic fermentation (that gives us shelf-stable cheese, salami, sauerkraut, etc), but also alcoholic fermentation must be included there too.  There''s no reason to think that the first fermented grains were fermented by accident.</p>

<ol>
<li>The beer must be brewed within the walls of a Trappist monastery,
either by the monks themselves or under their supervision.</li>
<li>The brewery must be of secondary importance within the monastery and
it should witness to the business practices proper to a monastic way
of life</li>
<li>The brewery is not intended to be a profit-making venture.  The
income covers the living expenses of the monks and the maintenance
of the buildings and grounds.  Whatever remains is donated to
charity for social work and to help persons in need.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are some standardized naming conventions, for instance the Double (orginally used by Westmalle) is a brown ale which has an alcohol level of around 7%. </p>

<p>The Tripple is another name first used by Westmalle, which are often blond and have an alcohol level of about 8% to 10%. </p>

<p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/bNvYJ.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<p>Orval has a very traditional and unique brewing process which involves
 the use of dry hopping, in which large meshed bags of hops infuse the beer during the three-week maturation period. The other is the use of Brettanomyces yeast during this same maturation, which are a local wild yeast. Hallertau, Styrian Goldings and French Strisselspalt hops are used. The beer is then matured at 15°C for a minimum of four weeks on site before being distributed.</p>

<p>If drunk right after bottling it has a "young" fresh flavor. The beer can be preserved for several years as it re-ferments once bottled. Even 35 year old Orval is still drinkable, if preserved at the right temperature. After about 1 year of preservation the beer flavor changes to a softer, sweeter and more intense experience compared to the young one.</p>

<p>There are two versions of Orval, one is the normal one which can be bought in the stores and then there is also a special <em>Petite Orval</em>, which can only be drunk at the Orval abbey and is only produced for the Monks (no mass sale).

<p>In my opinion it''s more about tradition than functionality.

<p>One mulls beer by simmering beer in a pan, nearly always with the following ingredients:</p>

<ul>
<li>ginger</li>
<li>nutmeg</li>
<li>cinnamon</li>
<li>cloves</li>
<li>honey, agave nectar, or sugar</li>
</ul>

<p>but also sometimes adding</p>

<ul>
<li>egg yolk</li>
<li>cardamon</li>
<li>star anise</li>
<li>coriander</li>
<li>black pepper</li>
<li>allspice berries</li>
</ul>

<p>and occasionally garnishing the drink with orange rinds. The mixture should be brought to a simmer but <em>not</em> a boil, and heated for 5 to 10 minutes depending on the recipe.</p>

<p>Some even refer to <em>warmed</em> beer as "mulled" beer, <em>i.e.</em> beer heated it <em>in its bottle</em> in a pot (or slowcooker) filled with water. For this case, there is not a consensus on the heating temperature, as it appears to vary according to the beer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mulled beer needs to be heated slowly. A slow-cooker half-filled with water works well. Just open the bottle and stand it in the uncovered appliance. I also have used a large pot on the stove, with the burner on low. Don''t let the water to get anywhere close to boiling -- 130 to 140 degrees is ideal. It''s also important to keep the water level constant, so replace the water as it evaporates.</p>

<h2>Beer is also alcohol</h2>

<p>That is directly from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_and_sex#Alcohol_and_sex_in_men" rel="nofollow">wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Men''s sexual behaviors can be affected dramatically by alcohol. Both chronic and acute alcohol consumption have been shown in most (but not all) studies to inhibit testosterone production in the testes. This is believed to be caused by the metabolism of alcohol reducing the NAD+/NADH ratio both in the liver and the testes; since the synthesis of testosterone requires NAD+, this tends to reduce testosterone production.</p>
  
  <p>As testosterone is critical for libido and physical arousal, alcohol tends to have deleterious effects on male sexual performance. Studies have been conducted that indicate increasing levels of alcohol intoxication produce a significant degradation in male masturbatory effectiveness (MME). This degradation was measured by measuring blood alcohol concentration (BAC) and ejaculation latency. Alcohol intoxication can decrease sexual arousal, decrease pleasureability and intensity of orgasm, and increase difficulty in attaining orgasm.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since wikipedia show related soruce of that info and most of them are clinical research, we can say that alcohol have a negative effect on men.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In many women, alcohol increases sexual arousal and desire, although it does lower the physiological signs of arousal. Women have a different response to alcohol intoxication. Studies have shown that acute alcohol consumption tends to cause increased levels of testosterone and estradiol. Since testosterone controls in part the strength of libido in women, this tends to cause an increase in interest in sex. Also, because women have a higher percentage of body fat and less water in their bodies, alcohol can have a quicker, more severe impact. Women’s bodies take longer to process alcohol; more precisely, a woman''s body often takes one-third longer to eliminate the substance.</p>
  
  <p>Sexual behavior in women under the influence of alcohol is also different from men. Studies have shown that increased BAC is associated with longer orgasmic latencies and decreased intensity of orgasm. Some women report a greater sexual arousal with increased alcohol consumption as well as increased sensations of pleasure during orgasm. Because ejaculatory response is visual and can more easily be measured in males, orgasmic response must be measured more intimately. In studies of the female orgasm under the influence of alcohol, orgasmic latencies were measured using a vaginal photoplethysmograph, which essentially measures vaginal blood volume.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Different from men, we can say alcohol have more pros beside few cons for women.</p>

<h2>Beer and couples</h2>

<h3>Men</h3>

<p>Beer is probably the least powerful aphrodisiac alcoholic drink. The alcohol percentage in beer is low, meaning that more liquid has to be consumed to raise men''s testosterone levels to hit that "comfortable" level. Most beers are very nourishing and filling, and when too many of them are consumed, they can create an unpleasant stomachache. Drinking too much beer will make men go to the washroom more often, as well as create a bloating sensation. The effects of being bloated surely don''t entice sexual encounters and won''t lead men to seek out sexual opportunities. Yet, some special beers have a local reputation for increasing libido, but even with that, beer is not the best choice for men.</p>

<h3>Women</h3>

<p>While hops in beer will have a negative impact on men’s hormonal balance, it may actually be positive for women. Hops has aphrodisiac-like qualities for women, as because of the phytoestrogen it contains, which mimic natural estrogen. Low sex drive in women is often cause by low levels of estrogen.</p>

<p>Consuming beer, especially hop-rich varieties like IPA, could actually help restore hormonal balance and help with libido and also alleviate menopausal symptoms of fatigue, irritability and hot flashes</p>

<p>Alcohol is reduced by starting with a lower amount of sugar in the wort (lower OG.) By fermenting less sugar, less alcohol is produced. The carbohydrates in beer are so-called residual sugars. These are reduced by reducing the amount of non-fermentable sugars, such as by adjusting the recipe to avoid malts that contain unfermentable sugars (such as Cara/Crystal malts, and highly kilned malts). Also the brewer can adjust the temperature that the grains are mashed to produce a more fermentable wort with less residual sugar.</p>

<p>To see how alcohol and carbs affect the calories in beer, here''s an excerpt from <a href="http://www.beer100.com/beercalories.htm">this table</a> that lists the % abv, grams of carbohydrates in a 12.oz serving:</p>

<pre><code>Name        Brewer          abv     cal.    carbohydrates
Busch Ice   Anheuser Busch  5.9%    169 12.5g     
Busch Light Anheuser Busch  4.1%    95  3.2g
</code></pre>

<p>The light beer has considerably less calories than the regular beer. In fact, around 80% of the calories in that beer come from the alcohol:</p>

<pre><code>1 g of alcohol = 7 kcal. 

1 g of carbohydrate = 4 kcal.

Volume of beer is 12oz. x 28.6g = 343ml.  Volume of alcohol is 4.1 % x
343 = 14 ml

To convert alcohol volume to weight, divide by 1.25. Weight of alcohol
is 14 / 1.25 = 11.2g 
</code></pre>

<p>So</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Energy from alcohol is 11.2 x 7 = 78.4 kcal. As percent: 78.4/95 =
  <strong>82%</strong> </p>
  
  <p>Energy from carbs is 3.2 x 4 = 12.8. As percent: 12.8/95 = <strong>13%</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>(The total is less than 100% - the data doesn''t account for protein, which is typically about 1g/12oz, which is about 4 kcal.)</p>

INSERT INTO post VALUES (258, NULL, NULL, '<p>First, there are currently beers that are served warm, particularly very dark ones.  So part of it has to do with the character of beer.</p>

<p>There are two important factors I see, looking at this as a history nut but not knowing of any sources on this topic.  The first, as you say, is widespread refrigeration.  But this was not the major factor in cold beverages generally since ice was often preserved into the summer for cooling beverages (and has been since ancient times).  But refrigeration makes this easier and thus cheaper.</p>

<p>The second is actually the modern bottlecap which is a product of industrialization.  Before the bottlecap most beers were served uncarbonated.  They might be chilled or not, but they would have been entirely uncarbonated, shipped in wooden barrels, etc. and had an altogether different flavor and character than our modern beers.  My experience playing with these concepts as a homebrewer suggests that such beers were better suited to being served warm than comparably dark carbonated beers.</p>

<p>To understand why, I think you have to look at carbonation and how temperature affects that.  Carbon dioxide is more soluble in cold water than warm water, so the warmer the beer is, the faster it goes flat, and the more it fizzes when opened.  So you have two ways carbonation affects the picture.  First it impacts the taste and serving conditions differently at different temperatures, and secondly it imparts a distinctive off-tang when the beer goes flat.  Temperature helps offset the latter to a mild extent but at the expense of the former.  I think this also helps explain why richer beers are more often served warm than lighter beers.</p>

INSERT INTO post VALUES (261, NULL, NULL, '<p>In answer to part of your question, there are probably no other reasons for large-scale cultivation of hops in the 8th century other than for brewing.  While hops were used in medicine, the major national herbals of Anglo-Saxon England don''t mention them.  That we have strong references in early 8th century England (see "Anglo-Saxon Food and Drink" by Ann Hagen) to comparatively large-scale cultivation of hops strongly suggests they were used in brewing.</p>

<p>Hops are used in medicine as well, but the amounts used there are very small in comparison to those used for brewing, and the two major Anglo-Saxon national herbals, Bald''s Leechbook and The Lacnunga don''t mention them (I think the Old English Herbarium does, but it is a translation into Old English of a continental Latin work).  Keep in mind most of my work with these has been in translation (Pollington''s) and translating plants from the descriptions often poses interesting issues.  I could probably find standarized editions in Old English if needed however.</p>

<p>One of the interesting connections here is that two of the most important early brewing herbs, hops and henbane, both had strong connections to female medical concerns (this is also interesting because historically brewing was women''s work, hence the obsolete term "alewife" not referring to a fish--- the woman''s place in keeping a tavern was privileged but brewing was sort of like cooking, something every woman was supposed to know).  Hops to heavy periods, and henbane was used to address pain in childbirth.  Both of these may contribute to Bald''s warning that pregnant women may drink ale safely but not beer, for beer would cause a risk of miscarriage.</p>

<p>In general for hops to be grown to an extent noteworthy, one is almost certainly talking about brewing, whether grains or honey, and whether alone or with other herbs.</p>

Even with the increases, the gulf in capacity between ''craft'' and the various major macrobrewers is so large as to render the adjustments to the definition of ''craft'' largely benign.

<p>Flavored beers can be made a bunch of different ways. You can add herbs, spices, or flavorings before or after the boil, for example.  Seeds and roots would usually be added before the boil; herbs would usually be added after.  I would probably add fruit after but this is something that folks could argue about forever.  If you buy something like smoke-flavored beer, chili flavored beer, etc. these are probably made this way.</p>

<p>There''s a second type of flavored beer I have seen for sale in certain bars and restaurants in Asia though.  That''s where you take a fairly light beer on tap and add it to a glass along with a shot of flavoring syrup (like lychee or peach).  These usually have sweeter flavor with clearer fruit flavors than the fermented fruit beers.  If the beer is pasteurized, the flavoring could be added before bottling and carbonation.

Edit: (This is controversial and certainly not enforced)</p>

<p>There are tons of flavors you can impart based on the types of hops and malts you use and when you add them in the brewing process.</p>

<p>When boiling the wort, you can add hops to impart flavor midway through the process. If you add them at the beginning, you get bitterness primarily from the hops. If you add them at the end, you get primarily aroma from the hops.</p>

<p>It is common practice to add hops in all 3 stages for those reasons.</p>

<p>There''s also a lot of flavor that you can add to the beer by aging it in barrels. It is common to use barrels from whiskey or bourbon for this purpose among craft brewers. This can add a huge punch of flavor in some beers. (This may be happening on in the Rogue beer you linked to)</p>

INSERT INTO post VALUES (267, NULL, NULL, '<p>The Rogue Voodoo Doughnut Maple Bacon Ale is an interesting example because the ingredients list shows two different ways flavors can be imparted to beer.  The smoky bacon flavor comes both from the actual inclusion of bacon and from the smoked malt: <em>Briess Cherrywood Smoked Malt, Weyermann Beechwood Smoked Malt, House-smoked Hickory Malt</em>.  As discussed in <a href="http://beer.stackexchange.com/questions/53/does-chocolate-stout-contain-real-chocolate/65#65">Does chocolate stout contain real chocolate?</a>, certain flavors can be achieved through the malting process rather than through additional ingredients.  Similarly maple is fermentable and could be added directly to boost alcohol content and impart a more subtle maple flavor.</p>

<p>That said, this beer does contain actual bacon and "maple flavor".  To get a look at and when and how the flavors are added, we can look at <a href="http://www.brewtoad.com/recipes/inspired-by-rogue-voodoo-doughnut-maple-bacon-ale" rel="nofollow">this clone recipe</a>. </p>

<pre><code>Name              Amount     Time        Use
Fenugreek         0.25 oz    5.0 min     Boil
Maple Extract     1.0 oz     6.0 days    Primary
Bacon, cooked     4.0 oz     0.0 days    Bottle
</code></pre>

<p>Here, fenugreek is added during the boil phase, while creating the wort.  The boiling helps extract the flavor from the herb.  Maple extract gets added later during fermentation.  Maple extract or syrup could be used, but syrup is more expensive and fermentable so a stronger maple flavor is being achieved with extract.  The official ingredient list calls for "Pure Maple Flavoring" so I assume the same is being done there.  Lastly the bacon is being added at the end.  This is to add direct flavoring to the beer without interfering in the fermentation process.</p>

<p>Beer and ale, being grain-based, were important dietary staples -- it''s said that beer is liquid bread, and that''s not far off.  For the common man (not nobility), in particular, grain made up a substantial part of the diet, with meat being fairly rare.  (Will try to update later with a friend''s research on amount of grain/household consumed in medieval England, but it''s substantial.)</p>

<p>Common beer was not aged for months or years like some beers today; rather, a batch might be produced in as little as half a week.  These are "small beers" (or "small ales", for the unhopped variety), which are mildly alcoholic but drinkable in volume without unfortunate effects.  These small beers/ales were produced in the home/manor; it was just one more task for the cooks.  (See, for example, Markham''s <em>The English Housewife</em>, 1615 -- so that''s rnnaissance not medieval, but is consistent with earlier cooking sources I''ve seen.)</p>

<p>I''m not aware of exceptions being made for pregnant women and small children.

  <p>Modern beer, however, has little in common with the drink that carried that name through the Middle Ages and Renaissance. Looking at a time when beer was often a nutritional necessity, was sometimes used as medicine, could be flavored with everything from the bark of fir trees to thyme and fresh eggs, <strong>and was consumed by men, women, and children alike</strong>...</p>
  
  <p><strong>It was the beverage of choice of urban populations that lacked access to secure sources of potable water</strong>; a commodity of economic as well as social importance; <strong>a safe drink for daily consumption that was less expensive than wine</strong>; and a major source of tax revenue for the state. </p>
  
  <p>Unger describes the transformation of the industry <strong>from small-scale production that was a basic part of housewifery</strong> to a highly regulated commercial enterprise dominated by the wealthy and overseen by government authorities.</p>

<p>Additionally I want to mention something I use it for.  This works for me because of very specific reasons and <strong>I am not recommending that anyone else try it.</strong>  However, I get asthma frequently following upper respiratory illnesses (I have since I was a teenager).  I have a couple of alternative medical strategies for dealing with this depending on what is available.  Note, if you have asthma, don''t take medical advice from me: asthma can be life threatening.  Work with a doctor.   However, among other things, I find that drinking a number of drinks of beer or wine for two nights in a row will cause the asthma to clear up until I get sick again.  This naturally works best when I am not otherwise consuming alcohol, but it allows me to be mostly medication free regarding my asthma (doing this two to three times a year).  Again this has a bunch of risks, so I am mentioning it just for informational purposes.  In general anything medical deserves a great deal of respect because what can cure can kill.</p>

<p>Also some kinds of traditional beer have very specific health benefits.  In Indonesia, "tape hitam" (black rice beer, consumed with the lees as a sort of soup) is generally understood to reduce blood cholesterol.  As it turns out the helper cultures used are extremely close (and sometimes the same) as those which produce lovostatin.  In fact lovostatin was originally found in Chinese fermented rice products.</p>

<p>Beer is, compositionally, pretty much the same.  There might be enough difference between a heavy chocolate stout and a hoppy IPA, but between different brands of lighter beers (like pilsners), there''s unlikely to be a noticeable difference in hangovers barring a weird food allergy to a minor element of one pilsner vs another.</p>

<p>Some far more likely causes of your friends reporting worse hangovers for different brands of the same beer type are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Different quantities between evenings.  One evening you drank 10 Pilsner Urquells and the next you drink 8 Beck''s.  How well are you really counting at that point?  If you think you had "about 9 beers" both nights, you might blame the worse hangover on Pilner Urquell.</li>
<li>Differences in alcohol level between brands.  The difference between 3.8% and 4.2% adds up after a while.</li>
<li>Small sample size.  Would you rely on a medical study of only 3 or 4 people?  Probably not.  Likewise, if your friend reports getting a bad hangover the last 3 or 4 times they drank Konig, it may just be a bit of coincidence, and they would have had a nasty hangover those nights regardless of what they drank.</li>

<li>it presents the beer (beauty is in the eye of the beer holder) showcasing the beer''s color, clarity and/or carbonation.</li>
<li>it influences how quickly volatiles (aromatics) are released</li>
<li>it influences how much beer can be consumed per sip (e.g. compare champagne flute vs. beer mug)</li>
<li>it can promote head retention (through the shape, plus small etchings in the base of the glass)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Some examples</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>A Pilsner glass is a long tall V-shaped glass. It emphasizes the
color, clarity and effervescence of the Pilsner. It''s similar in
principle to the fluted champagne glass, but having larger rim,
affords larger sips.</p></li>
<li><p>The traditional mug is a robust glass, primarly aimed at "chinking"
glasses together and allowing large swallows of beer. </p></li>
<li><p>The challace/goblet can be beautiful pieces of work, designed to
showcase the beer, and also promote and maintain a large head. </p></li>
<li><p>The tulip glass captures volatiles (in the narrow part of the glass)
while the large opening at the top supports a large head.</p></li>
<li><p>The Sniffer, typically used for cognac/brandy, but also for very
strong ales, has a large base that curves up to a small opening to
capture the aromatics, and to allow for swirling to encourage more
aromatics to be released.</p></li>
<li><p>The Stange, a long tall glass, amplifies the malt and hop
characteristics by concentrating them in a smaller area, while also
providing a simple elegant presentation of the beer. Often used with
delicate beers.</p></li>
<li><p>The Weizen glass is similar to the pilsner glass, but larger
(typically 0.5l minimum) with plenty of room for the large head
typical of a wheat beer.</p></li>

<p>With that said, most of the recipes I''m seeing make it clear that you want to use a light beer, so obviously you''re not gonna want to use a stout or porter here (though I''d be curious how it tastes; my friend swears by Guinness in his beef stew). With that said, most lagers or pilsners (a type of lager) should be fine for your purposes (of course I would avoid macro-lagers like Bud, Coors, and Miller because they are awful). <a href="http://www.anchorbrewing.com/beer/anchor_steam" rel="nofollow">Anchor Steam Beer</a> might be interesting in the soup as it packs a lot of flavor for a lager type beer in my opinion. For authenticity, you''re likely gonna want to use a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilsner" rel="nofollow">pilsner</a>. You have to realize, as the Wikipedia article points out, that until the 1840''s or so, most beer from the area was top-fermented (like ales; modern pilsners and lagers are bottom-fermented) and the taste varied widely, so I''m not sure how a beer 300-500 years ago would have tasted. The closest you''ll likely be able to go back is the 1840''s; in which case I''d give Pilsner Urquell a shot as it''s the first pilsner beer in the world. Victory makes a mean pilsner (<a href="http://www.victorybeer.com/beers/braumeister-pils/" rel="nofollow">Braumeister Pils</a>) too. Unfortunately it''s draft only, so if you have a growler handy you can use it; otherwise best look elsewhere. Of course you can probably get away with most <a href="http://beeradvocate.com/beer/style/40/?start=50" rel="nofollow">Czech pilsners</a>. I can''t figure out why Beer Advocate doesn''t have a sorting option so that you can sort based upon the rating, but I digress. </p>

<p>You have to remember that beer was much different 300-500 years ago. Yes, there are some breweries such as  Dogfish Head who recreate ancient ales. Yards has also recreated three brews based upon George Washington''s, Thomas Jefferson''s, and Ben Franklin''s (my favorite of the three) original recipes. But for the most part, beer has evolved in the last 300-500 years; even in the case of the Dogfish Head and Yards brews I mentioned since they have to be pasteurized and must meet the (stupid) FDA standards here in the US. If you''ve ever tried raw milk, you know how much pasteurization changes the flavor; same goes for juice and beer.</p>

<p>With that said, lets go back to the whole top-fermenting thing. You might want to give a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr%C3%A4tzer" rel="nofollow">grätzer</a> a try as well. It''s an ancient Polish beer which has been recently making a comeback. There''s a <a href="http://sfbrewersguild.org/blog/historic-gratzer-beer-recreated-by-team-of-san-francisco-brewers" rel="nofollow">project</a> going on right now to recreate the brew. However, since the brew is so (recently) new, I''m not sure how available it is; you''ll likely have to make a trip to San Francisco to get some. There are others too, such as those offered by <a href="http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/24134/81644/" rel="nofollow">Westbrook Brewing Co.</a> and <a href="http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/piwo-grodziskie--gratzer-ale/157564/" rel="nofollow">Schlossbrauerei Au</a>. But I''m not sure how readily available these are either. You''re probably better off brewing this once yourself until this beer is pulled off the "endangered beers" list. <a href="http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2011/08/beer-styles-grodziski-gratzer-polish-smoked-wheat-beer-history.html" rel="nofollow">Yards has also experimented</a> with this style, but again, it''s not readily available (see <a href="http://www.yardsbrewing.com/retired." rel="nofollow">Tadeusz Kosciuszko Smoked Pol</a>)</p>

INSERT INTO post VALUES (321, NULL, NULL, '<p>A few notes on brewing and the seasons.  It isn''t a question of availability today but there are other factors that likely have seasonal impact.</p>

<p>Traditionally (say, 1000 years ago), yes, brewing recipes would vary with the seasons.  Some ingredients like henbane seed or barley keep extremely well.  Others do better  fresh (herbs and such).  It is likely that gruit components varied with the seasons.  This is not an issue today.  Aside from some components of other beers (pumpkin ale, beers with seasonal fruit), most beers today do not involve ingredients that are problematic to preserve over a year.</p>

<p>There is a second issue though.  That is that beers traditionally have another factor which is starch content.  The starch contributes significantly to calorie count of the beer, and usually darker, richer beers have higher carbohydrate count.  It makes sense to consume more calories in cold weather than warm weather, and it makes sense that darker, heavier beers would be favored in winter while lighter beers would be favored in summer (although as one would note the heavier beers came out of traditions of using them as bread substitutes for fasting monks and so would have year-round applicability in monasteries).</p>

<p>I don''t think it has to do with availability.  I think instead it has to do with seasonal expectations and reserving richer, heavier, higher starch beers for the winter (we have higher metabolism in winter, see <a href="http://www.mate.tue.nl/mate/pdfs/4319.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.mate.tue.nl/mate/pdfs/4319.pdf</a>, and generally less availability of fresh foods before modern refrigeration and rapid transport).  I don''t know when this became common though.  In general, when I look back a thousand years ago, I don''t see anything in primary sources to suggest heavier malts in the winter.  So trying to date this would seem speculative.  There is a fairly obvious practical pattern though.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:  As I think about this, I would note that aside from lagers, it is very hard to brew in the winter in a colder climate.  There may also be a component where heavier, stronger beers keep better and therefore keep into the winter better.</p>

INSERT INTO post VALUES (322, NULL, NULL, '<p>The answer is complex, to be honest.  In the Middle Ages?  Where?  When?  These are important questions.  Lumping around a thousand years and very different cultural eras (ranging from the Vendell-era Norse to the Byzantine Empire) into the same label is problematic at the very least.</p>

<p>The answer I think to the question as stated has to be "no" insofar as there were times and places in the Middle Ages where beer was a clear luxury (early medieval Iceland comes to mind).  Similarly, it isn''t always clear that beer was universally consumed by the lower classes in much of the Middle Ages (though certainly towards the end it became more common).</p>

<p>Example 1:  Anglo-Saxon England</p>

<p>This being said, beer was an important dietary staple in much (though not all!) of medieval Europe at least among monks, merchants, and the upper classes.  Heavier beers were used as bread substitutes.  For the common man in Anglo-Saxon England, though, even bread was a luxury  and most grains were cooked into gruel, porridge, either with or without fracturing (think of bulgur wheat).  This would then be supplemented with vegetables, eggs, dairy, and sometimes meat (even for the serfs, at least in Anglo-Saxon England, meat was not out of the question).  Well water was the primary source of hydration in this era (again see Hagen, below), and laws were passed to ensure that drinking water directly from someone else''s well was protected, legal activity (in other words, a well owner could restrict what people could take away from the well, but not what they could drink on the spot).</p>

<p>If we separate out the lower classes and the areas where beer was not commonly available (Iceland, for example) the picture changes dramatically.  Beer was very common, but not at all a homogeneous beverage.  Bald''s Leechbook (10th Century, Anglo-Saxon) contains the warning that while "ealu" (-> ale) may be consumed by pregnant women, "beor" (-> beer) causes miscarriage.  Identifying these beverages is problematic. Ann Hagen ("Anglo-Saxon Food and Drink") suggests that "beor" must have been a strong mead instead of a malt liquor based on descriptions of specific gravity (she calculates a minimum alcohol content of around 20%).  If it was a strong mead, it may have been further supplemented by herbs like mugwort, henbane, and hops, and therefore even more problematic than a strong mead might be.  In this case, it would have been fermented grains would have been certainly consumed by children and pregnant women.</p>

<p>Interestingly the traditional fermented rice and cassava dishes here in Indonesia are acceptable to serve to children too.</p>

<p>Example 2:  Medieval Iceland</p>

<p>The early Icelandic settlers tried to grow barley for beer with only very limited success.  Alcoholic beverages were thus very much a luxury item, and usually if someone was going to have it (going mostly by medieval saga evidence as ethnography), it was going to be someone who had gone viking and returned with a fair bit of wealth.  A second point though is that Icelandic society recognized about three levels of society (godhi, bondi, and thrall) based on relationship to certain kinds of property:  a godhi (priest-attorney-legislator-jurist) owned a godhord (the office was property and could be sold, loaned, or even put into partnership property).  A bondi (free juryman) owned land.  And a thrall was owned (though the actual requirements would have been more like early serfdom than slavery due to a lack of central administration and enforcement).  In addition to successful bondi-turned-vikings, you would have had the fact that a godhi had sufficient economic benefits from office to likely be able to afford alcoholic beverages at least sometimes.</p>

<p>In Iceland, drinking was usually a social action and as far as the existing evidence goes would have been a specifically male activity limited to the sorts of ritualized drinking portrayed in Beowulf (such ritualized drinking is portrayed in the Volsung Saga, Egill''s Saga, Njall''s Saga, and many many others).  Drunkenness was warned against in the literature, and there are very interesting questions of what else was put in the beverages, since poisoning was a pretty clear concern in the literature (Eddic poems such as Havamal and Sigdrifumal speak to both these concerns).  From archaeological evidence from "continental" Scandinavia, we may surmise henbane was common, and this may to some extent play into the references to military drinking in Hrolf Kraki''s Saga.</p>

<p>In short, in Iceland, as far as we can tell, beer and mead would have been limited to far more ritualized roles (reinforcing social obligations, certain forms of oaths, etc).  Literature on women and alcohol is very sparse.  It''s probable that the bride drank at the wedding as part of making the wedding official.  There''s a lot of uncertainty beyond this however in terms of attitudes towards pregnancy and alcohol.</p>

<p>Somehow, I''d never heard of or seen them!</p>

<p>A flight is 4 or 5 small servings of beer, typically in 4.5- to 5-oz. glasses, usually served on a "paddle." At least in San Diego, a flight costs as much as a pint on draught, so often it''s a no-brainer to get flights if you want to taste a variety of beers. When you order a flight, you of course get to choose what 4 or 5 beers you''d like to have. I often select similar beers—a set of stouts and porters—or a bunch of IPAs (and doubles)—so I can really get a chance to taste what distinguishes specific brands and subtypes.</p>

<p>When a friend of mine flew in from New York (also never having heard of flights), he was enthusiastic about getting two flights and sharing all 10—doing blind tests on one another. He went from saying, before we got to the bar, "All beer tastes the same to me—I can only taste dark or light," to, "Oh man, I didn''t know I was even capable of tasting such little differences!"</p>

<p>So, beer flights are an effective yet casual and fun way to get yourself or anyone to appreciate the multifarious tastes of beers.</p>

<p>I think trying to start with all the ingredients, brewing processes, and the (dizzying) gamut of terminologies for all the subtle tastes, might be like teaching someone to drive by starting with the difference between torque and horsepower—they can''t fully appreciate the meaning of words until they''ve <em>experienced</em> the sensations they describe. By contrasting beers side-by-side, we build an <em>internal</em>, as-of-yet-wordless "vocabulary" of tastes, <em>e.g</em> "This beer has more of... <em>that thing</em>, whatever it''s called, than this one," and <em>then</em> we learn terminology (and ingredients and processes) as a means of filling those voids in words for senses we''ve experienced. Otherwise, we''re storing abstract definitions, which we don''t retain very well.</p>

The format doesn''t matter much, but I prefer a multi-part tasting form to force me to think about each part of the beer.  For example, I usually break it down into 4 sections:</p>

<ul>
<li>Appearance: How much head?  How long did the head last?  What color was it?  What color is the beer itself?</li>
<li>Aroma: What do you smell?  How strong is the smell?</li>
<li>Taste: What do you taste?  How does that compare what you smelled?  How''s the aftertaste?</li>
<li>Mouthfeel: Usually just watery, oily, or creamy.</li>
</ul>

<p>Having different glasses for different types of beers can affect your drinking experience in a number of different ways. First off, having an unusual or unique glass can often be very fun, because it''s probably not something you''re used to. The first time I ever drank beer from a litre mug was a very fun experience for me, and not because it made the beer taste differently. Secondly, I find that different types of glasses encourage me to enjoy beer in different ways. I find that glasses with stems, which are often used for stronger beers, encourage me to drink the beer more slowly and savour it a bit more than a glass without a stem. I think these effects on experience are one of the big reasons for the wide variations in beer glassware. As a beer manufacturer, if I could make a unique glass that will better help people remember my beer, I would consider that a worthwhile investment.</p>

<li><strong>Always rinse your glasses immediately</strong>: your job''s much harder if the lacing and sediment dries caked on the glass.</li>
<li><strong>Hand wash your glassware</strong>, not only because of the detergent, but also because the best glasses are made of the thinnest glass, so they''re quite delicate.</li>
<li><strong>Use a beer-specific cleaning agent</strong>, a percarbonate cleaner like PBW, One-Step or B-Brite.  These are formulated specifically to deal with the compounds that beer leaves in a glass.</li>

The tang you feel is dissolved metal and a component of that, depending on the pewter, may be lead (or could be copper, tin, bismuth, antimony, etc).  A major factor in that is acidity, and both hops and carbonation contribute.</p>

<p>Acidic solutions react with metals to produce hydrogen gas and dissolved metal salts.  So carbonic acid from carbonated beer will react with the tin to produce hydrogen and tin carbonate, and the same basic process with other metals.  The specific metal that reacts will depend on the pewter.</p>

<p>There are some ways around this.  You could, for example, coat the inside of the vessel with bees wax.  This can then be washed by hand with hot tap water and soap (and is a common method in making drinking horns).

<li>You want to have the beer as a regular drink nearby that does not disturb the taste of the

The taste does not sit in your mouth too long, thus if you wait a moment (few seconds) between beer and the mashed potatoes, it should not cause any trouble with them, too.</p>

It does not have a long lasting taste, goes well with mashed potato and does not clash with the steak.</p>

<p>A more recent study summarizes how China came under scrutiny, but also how industry standards have changed since (emphasis mine, hereon):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In 2005, various Chinese newspapers reported that formaldehyde was detected in 95% of the samples of Chinese commercial bottled beers tested in the course of a journalistic investigation. The addition of formaldehyde during mashing is allowed in China, and it is believed to improve the clarity of the resulting wort and beer and the colloidal stability of the latter. <strong>Nevertheless, the hygienic standard for fermented alcoholic beverages in China was revised, to stipulate that the formaldehyde content of the finished beer must not exceed 2 mg/L.</strong></p>

<p>From the abstract of the same paper,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Beers brewed commercially in China have been surveyed for the presence of a number of potential contaminants, including benzene, trihalomethanes and formaldehyde. [...] Formaldehyde was measured in 29 beers (including 7 imported brands) using solid-phase microextraction with on-fiber derivatization. Formaldehyde levels were between 0.082&ndash;0.356 mg/L. <strong>None of the beer samples exceeded WHO drinking water criteria for benzene, trihalomethanes or formaldehyde.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The researchers compared their results to existing literature, which they found were similar:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Donhauser and co-workers examined beers from Europe, using a HPLC method, and showed that 65% of them contained detectable formaldehyde, although in many the level was close to the detection limit of 0.2 mg/L. More recently, the South Korean Food and Drug Administration has analysed imported beers (13 from China and 4 from Germany). They found that the average content of formaldehyde was 0.132 mg/L, which was compatible with food safety legislation.</p>

<p>Apparently, formaldehyde does appear naturally in the brewing process (though, again, I couldn''t find the study, only <a href="http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?f=2012/OV/OV201203266003266.xml;DE19950083764">another citation</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Borchert has confirmed that formaldehyde can be formed naturally in the brewing process, thus beers can contain up to 0.1 mg/L of formaldehyde, even when none is used in the brewery.</p>

<p>Anyway, formaldehyde no longer seems preferred as a clarification agent, as a substitute exists:</p>

<blockquote>

INSERT INTO post VALUES (437, NULL, NULL, '<h1>Add sugar to bottle-conditioned beer</h1>

<p><em>Warning</em>: This method is error-prone, high-effort, and probably not worth your time.  Could be fun, though.  :)</p>

<p>Most commercial beer is <em>force-carbonated</em>.  That is to say, the beer is produced and ready to drink (minus the fizz) before they put it in the bottle and mechanically carbonate the beer.</p>

<p>Beer that is <em>bottle-conditioned</em> or <em>bottle-fermented</em>, however, is put into a bottle with some extra sugar.  The beer is intentionally left with a little of the yeast from the fermentation process, and is sealed with the sugar.  The yeast then does it''s normal thing: it eats the sugar and excretes alcohol plus carbon-dioxide.  Since the bottle is sealed, the CO2 has nowhere to go, so it goes into dissolution in the beer, giving you that fizz.  Most bottled homebrew will be like this.</p>

<p>So, if you have a beer that is both flat and was bottle-conditioned (and therefore still has some yeast in it), you might be able to bottle-ferment it again:</p>

<ol>
<li>Add a very small amount of sugar to the bottle.  Table sugar works, although corn sugar (which you can find from a brew store) is ideal.  It''ll be really hard to get the right amount (about 0.083 oz), so I recommend pre-measured tablets of the stuff: <a href="http://www.northernbrewer.com/shop/munton-s-carb-tabs.html">http://www.northernbrewer.com/shop/munton-s-carb-tabs.html</a></li>
<li>Seal the bottle somehow.  If you have a <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B000Q6ARMY">bottle-capper</a> and some caps, that''d be ideal.  Otherwise, you might be able to get by with a soda bottle and cap.  If you''re really lucky, your beer is in a <a href="http://www.homebrewers.com/media/img/homebrewer/W1033-H1573-Bffffff/B/xbottle_swingtop_amber_16oz_.jpg">swing top</a> bottle.</li>
<li>Wait a week, maybe a couple to be sure.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you''re lucky, there''s enough viable yeast in the bottle to start acting again (now that it has new sugar to eat), which will create more CO2 and recarbonate the bottle.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When pairing IPA with food you have three basic flavor hooks at your disposal; bitterness, hop flavor (spicy, grassy, herbal, earthy, and citrus), and caramel. Hop flavors have a great affinity for spices and light fruits. Bitterness has a cooling affect. Paired with <strong>spicy dishes</strong>, IPA will fan the flames at first, but douse them in the end. Bitterness also amplifies <strong>salty and umami flavors</strong>. The caramel flavors in the beer will latch onto the sweeter side of a dish, tying into things like <strong>caramelized onion</strong> or the crispy skins of roast poultry. And the hop acids and carbonation make IPAs <strong>great palate cleansers</strong> to take on even the fattiest deep-fried delights.</p>

<p>The layman''s summary from <a href="http://gizmodo.com/the-fascinating-science-behind-why-a-tapped-beer-foams-1451022759/1451360561/@jesusdiaz">Scientists discover why beer bottles overflow after a sudden impact</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A lot happens in the short period of time between tap and torrent. The
  moment some jerk clocks your bottle''s mouth, a compression wave
  travels down through the glass. When the wave hits bottom, it''s
  reflected as an expansion wave that travels through the beer. These
  waves keep bouncing back and forth, with the compression waves
  breaking up the CO2 bubbles in your beer into thousands of incredibly
  tiny microbubbles, and the expansion waves causing those microbubbles
  to violently expand into skyrocketing plumes.</p>
  
  <p>The result? Millions and millions of expanding CO2 bubbles turn your
  beer into foam shooting out of your bottle. With any luck, it spills
  all over your jerk friend''s pants.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The abstract from the <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.3747">published article</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A sudden vertical impact on the mouth of a beer bottle generates a
  compression wave that propagates through the glass towards the bottom.
  When this wave reaches the base of the bottle, it is transmitted to
  the liquid as an expansion wave that travels to free surface, where it
  bounces back as a compression wave. This train of
  expansion-compression waves drives the forced cavitation of existing
  air pockets, leading to their violent collapse. A cloud of very small
  daughter bubbles are generated upon these collapses, that expand much
  faster than their mothers due to their smaller size. These rapidly
  growing bubble clusters effectively act as buoyancy sources, what
  leads to the formation of bubble-laden plumes whose void fraction
  increases quickly by several orders of magnitude, eventually turning
  most of the liquid into foam.</p>

<p>The "Pale" in Pale Ale is mostly historical. In the 18th century, most beers were dark due to being produced with barley malt that was kilned or roasted over wood fires.

This applied to both ales and lagers, resulting in beers that were bronze, copper or gold—and while you wouldn''t look at such colors today and consider them notably "pale," they certainly were pale in contrast to beers back then. In the turn of the 19th century and beyond, the style spread from England to the rest of Europe—</p>

INSERT INTO post VALUES (476, NULL, NULL, '<p>Part of the answer has to do with how the beverages survived prohibition.  Winemakers were allowed to continue producing various grape products like grape juice, and even sold home wine kits with explicit instructions on how to avoid making wine from them.  Very tongue-in-cheek.  A lot of liquor distillers managed to survive somewhat on their liquors being considered "medicinal".  Beer, however, basically got demolished.  Especially considering their suffering during World War 1, which had just ended when prohibition began.  Any businesses that survived prohibition that used to be breweries either became producers of other products like ice cream or made barely alcoholic barley-based beverages.  Brewing in the US was at a huge disadvantage coming out of prohibition, and the few surviving large companies managed to successfully lobby to have the new distribution laws written to benefit them.</p>

<p>Also, as I mentioned wine and liquor sort of continued to be produced during Prohibition.  This led to their presence in the speakeasies, and their inclusion in the invention of many new cocktails.  People being used to them over the past few years, and the allure of being what was drank in speakeasies, acted as built in marketing.  Which beer lacked.</p>

<p>Finally, beer was much less transportable than wine or liquor, especially liquor.  While localized wineries managed to survive, most people''s local brewery had folded.  Liquor and wine became go-to drinks, and the only beer being promoted was from a few larger companies that needed to ramp up to reach everyone.  They were basically able to write their own ticket.</p>

<p>We''re sort of in the opposite place now where consumer demand is for beer instead of liquor and wine, and the demand is for beer that''s coming from smaller and more regional breweries, which I imagine is how wine was back in the day.</p>

<p>The companies that make beer are not generally the same ones that make liquor.  Those two groups of companies also have different groups of lobbyists, who have pushed for laws at different times in different political climates.</p>

<h1>Part of it is practical</h1>

<p>Liquor and beer production face different logistical needs.  For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Beer has much higher shipping costs per dollar worth of product, so shipping rules might need to be different.</li>
<li>Breweries have a need to keep their product cold at the point of sale, so it might make sense to have them sold in stores that already have coolers (like gas stations), whereas liquor companies wouldn''t push as hard for that availability.</li>
<li>Liquor has no equivalent of the brewpub, so they don''t really care much about sales at their production facility.</li>
<li>Beer has less consumer utility per unit of volume than liquor (ie, you need more of it to have the same amount of fun), so people generally need it closer to their houses.  Since you don''t need to buy liquor as often as you buy beer, it''s more feasible to have centralized liquor stores</li>

<h3>tl;dr — Alcohol is a diuretic (defined: <em>a substance that promotes the production of urine</em>), causing you to expel more water than the body would normally expel.</h3>

<p>That much has been shown conclusively.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If sufficient alcohol is ingested, the diuresis occurs at the expense of all cellular components, and dehydration ensues.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><sup><a href="http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=568848">Roberts, K. E. Mechanism of Dehydration Following Alcohol Ingestion. 1963. [Abstract (HTML)]</a></sup></p>

<p>As far back as the 1930s, researchers were trying to understand whether alcohol—the substance itself—is a diuretic, or indirectly induces chemicals which are diuretic (or which inhibit antidiuretics) or triggers cortical functions that cause diuresis.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Most] writers either state categorically or imply that alcohol per se has no diuretic action. In 1932, however, from a comparison of the diuretic effects of a given volume of water, with and without alcohol, [...] Murray concluded that alcohol itself was exerting a diuretic action. [...] The diuretic action of alcohol has now been demonstrated on five other subjects, and its mode of action investigated [...]</p>
</blockquote>

<p><sup><a href="http://jp.physoc.org/content/101/2/172.full.pdf">Eggleton, M. G. The Diuretic Action of Alcohol in Man. 1941. [Full Paper (PDF)]</a></sup></p>

<p>The first paper (1963) actually confirmed that <strong>alcohol—yes, ethanol itself—inhibits antidiuretic hormones, causing diuresis, causing dehydration.</strong> (Caffeine does this too, by the way.)</p>

<p>So, yeah. That''s how that happens.</p>

<hr>

<p>Unrelated, but I found this interesting in the second paper...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It [the diuresis] is initiated by the <em>increase</em> in blood-alcohol concentration and fails to be maintained if this concentration is kept steady, even at high levels [...] The diuretic response to alcohol differs markedly in one respect from that of the cerebral cortex. The latter is most affected by the <em>rate</em> of increase in blood-alcohol concentration: the greater this rate of increase, the greater the disturbance of function at any absolute concentration. The diuretic response, on the other hand, is dependent mainly on the <em>duration</em> of increasing blood-alcohol concentration and not on the rate of increase (Tables 6, 7). The naturally slow absorber, therefore, tends to give a larger diuretic response than the rapid absorber.</p>

INSERT INTO post VALUES (502, NULL, NULL, '<p>In short, the main factors in aging is a combination of compounds breaking down and oxidation.</p>

<h2>IPAs - hop aroma breakdown</h2>

<p>For IPAs, it''s the hop aromas that break down fairly quickly - the aromatic compounds are volatile and break down noticably within a short timeframe:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tom Nielsen, Sierra Nevada’s senior research analyst focused on hop
  degradation, says that their research has shown that after about two
  and a half to three months, hop aroma in a packaged beer, derived
  mainly from beta acids in the hop flower, has already started to
  diminish significantly. It’s a sentiment backed by Patrick Langlois at
  Great Divide in Denver, brewers of notable hoppy beers including their
  Fresh Hop Pale Ale, Titan IPA, and Hercules Double IPA. “Hops tend to
  dissipate in three to four months, which is why that is the
  recommended shelf life for most of our beers. 
  (<a href="http://beeradvocate.com/community/threads/how-much-does-keeping-a-beer-cold-really-help-retain-hop-aroma.6336/">Source</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Barley Wines - Oxidation</h2>

<p>Barley wines are not hop flavor or aroma focused beers - the major hop component is bittering acids, so they don''t suffer the same problem with aroma losses as IPAs. However, some of the bittering compounds also have a <a href="http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0100-40422000000100019">half-life of 1 year</a>, so clear changes are happening in that timeframe to the bitterness.</p>

<p>However, the major change for a barleywine is oxidation. There is always oxygen in the beer - either small amounts introduced during packaging, or from oxidization during the mash, which is then later released into the beer. When alcohol in the beer oxidizes, it becomes ethanal (acetaldehyde) which is a main component in sherry, and gives apple or sherry-like tones, which in a big barleywine are considered positive effects of aging, if kept in check. </p>

<h2>Stouts</h2>

<p>Contrasting with both IPAs and barleywines, Stouts that are meant for aging are neither hop focused nor benefit much from oxidation. Oxidizing the medium roasted malts in the wort would produce cardboard flavors due to production of <a href="http://brewingreality.blogspot.no/2010/04/flavour-compound-of-week-trans-2.html">trans-2-nonenal</a>. Fortunately, the highly kilned malts act as an anti-oxidant to help prevent the beer from oxidizing. What little odization does occur tends to produce port-like flavors.</p>

<p>The roasty character in stout comes from large Maillard compounds. These are still poorly understood, I can''t find research to back it up, but I would guess the roasty character mellows due to the large compounds breaking down into shorter ones. This might explain why in some stouts the dark fruit flavors become more emphasized over time (since they are shorter Maillard compounds.)</p>

INSERT INTO post VALUES (505, NULL, NULL, '<p>It''s complicated.  I think you have to look at these laws as an intersection of the practical and the cultural.</p>

<p>Let''s look at two different distinctions you make.</p>

<p><strong>Home Production</strong></p>

<p>In the US, you can usually make your own beer, mead, or wine, but cannot make hard liquor without a license from BATF, state licenses, tax payments, etc.  Exact laws of course vary state by state, but the US tax code contains exemptions for home brewers and wine makers.</p>

<p>Part of the reason here is historical.  Liquor is a major tax source, and black market liquor hasn''t always been very safe.  We hear stories about wood alcohol making people go blind, but the real problems were either accidental heavy metal poisoning or deliberate adulteration with relatively nasty chemicals.  In practice methyl alcohol was not a major problem, particularly accidental inclusion of it, as in most concentrations primarily makes the hangover significantly worse (btw, red wine is known for harsh hangovers as are some fruit brandies because of methyl alcohol content).  The adulterants have included (and do include in some parts of the world) things like battery acid, caustic soda, and the like.</p>

<p>A second problem of course is safety.  In the distilling process, you are dealing the combination, usually, of heating elements or open flames and a liquid that is roughly as flammable as gasolene.  While it is quite possible to distil safely, there are generally acknowledged gains health and safety-wise to pushing for a formal economy here.</p>

<p><strong>Wine Tastings vs Beer Tastings</strong></p>

<p>Here laws vary considerably between states.  For example, the one part of the liquor code that is explicitly applied to home brewers is an exemption for home brewing competitions.  So you can take your beer to a competition without losing the home brewing exemption.</p>

<p>Wine tastings have almost always had some acceptance on the theory that making fine wine has a level of cultural refinement and aesthetic nuance that beer does not (we may find this false but it an attitude --- if you don''t believe me, compare reading a wine review with a beer review).  The wine culture is different from the beer culture and so they make a different case.</p>

<p>Again laws here vary state by state.  However, the argument, I think, is that wine tasting is essential to the sales process, while beer drinkers are less picky on average.</p>

<p>In essence these laws have a practical component particularly where hard liquor is concerned, and a cultural component.</p>

<h2>OG is “Original Gravity”</h2>

<p>Specific Gravity (often shorted to just ‘gravity’) is a measure of the density of a liquid.  Since its is mostly water, you can compare beer’s density to water to find out how much other stuff is in it.  Water has a gravity of 1.000, and beers will often have an original gravity of 1.200 to 1.020.</p>

<p>“Original Gravity” is the density of beer before it’s fermented (when it’s called ‘wort’), and “Final Gravity” is the density after it’s fermented.  You can determine the alcohol content of a beer by comparing the two gravities and inferring how much fermentable “stuff” disappeared during fermentation (i.e., was converted to alcohol and CO2).</p>

<p>In commercial beer, you can use OG as a shorthand for how “Big” the beer is because it indicates how much malt and other fermentable stuff was in it.  So a lighter-flavored beer like a blonde or a pilnser will often have a low original gravity (1.020 to 1.050, for example), whereas a big stout or barelywine might have a higher original gravity (1.080 up to as much as 1.200).</p>

<p>OG is in important measurement for home brewers, so another use of it on a commercial beer is to help people produce clones of said beer at home by reproducing the OG (among other factors).</p>

<h3>Definition</h3>

<p>To get a little more technical, Specific Gravity is the ratio of the density of one liquid to another.  In brewing, we always use water.  So, the density of water divided by the density of water is 1.000.  The density of beer divided by the density of water is what we refer to as ‘gravity’ when discussing beer.  And since it’s a ratio of two identical measures, there are no units.  It’s not 1.000 somethings; it’s just 1.000.</p>

<h3>Plato</h3>

<p>Homebrewers often use "brewer''s points" (eg 1.123), but you''ll sometimes see the "Plato Scale", which is more popular in central Europe.  A good approximation is that 1˚ plato = 4 brewer''s points.  So 12˚ Plato corresponds to a gravity of 1.048.</p>

INSERT INTO post VALUES (510, NULL, NULL, '<p>From the figures you posted,</p>

<p>OG - "Original Gravity". When measured with a hydrometer, it measures the density relative to water. E.g. 1.010 is 1% heavier than water. The units here are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_measurement#Strength" rel="nofollow">degrees Plato</a> (&deg;P), which describe the amount of dissolved sugars. Here, 15 means 15% dissolved sugar. This means the beer (or more correctly, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wort" rel="nofollow">wort</a>) contained 15% sugar before fermentation started.</p>

<p>RDF - The real degree of fermentation. This is in contrast to the Apparent Degree of Fermentation, which is (OG-FG)/OG. When the final gravity is measured using hydrometer, the alcohol in the beer, being less dense than water (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol" rel="nofollow">SG. 0.789</a>) causes the gravity to appear lower, so it looks as though the yeast has fermented more sugar than it actually has. The Real degree of Fermentation takes the alcohol into account and computes the actual amount of sugars fermented. This tells you the how much of the original sugar was fermented (as a percentage). </p>

<p>So, what does this mean in practice?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Winter Bock - 15 OG, 62.5 RDF - light, tasty, ever so slightly bitter</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This has an average RDF for a beer that size, so it will be somewhat malty, but not cloying.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hazelnut Dark - 15 OG, 60.4 RDF - nice bitter red with slightly sweet aftertaste</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This has more dissolved sugars in it compared to the Bock, so you''d expect it to be a thicker mouthfeel and slightly more sweet, although you may not taste the sweetness if it''s offset by roasted malts.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Chocolate Stout - 14.8 OG, 66.8 RDF - very sweet with hints of chocolate and malt</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Being the driest of all the beers, yet the taste description is given as very sweet. This shows that knowing the residual sugars doesn''t tell you the sweetness, simply because there are different kinds of residual sugar. For example, dextrins create body, but have relatively little taste, so would taste not as sweet as a beer containing a lot of residual maltose or glucose. </p>

INSERT INTO post VALUES (514, NULL, NULL, '<p>A rye beer is any beer that incorporates rye, usually malted rye. </p>

<p><strong>How much Rye and how it tastes</strong></p>

<p>There are no laws to state that the quantity of rye should be above some minimum, so some rye beers include just a few percent of the malt bill as rye, while others such as Roggenbier base their entire flavor profile on rye, using over 50% rye malt. With such a large difference in the grain bill and the amount of rye, the two beers taste very different.</p>

<p>When rye is added to beer between 10-20% of the grain bill, it gives a pleasant spiciness and bread-like quality to the beer that blends well with most hop types, particularly spicy or citrussy hops. Rye can also add some dryness to the aftertaste.</p>

<p>Above 20% the spiciness becomes progressively more assertive and the beer fuller, more earthy and hearty, and perhaps not unsurprisingly, tastes similar to rye bread.</p>

<p><strong>Var-rye-ation</strong></p>

<p>Rye beers show considerable variation. Rye is a versatile ingredient, which has become increasingly popular recently with craft brewers, so there is no longer a common theme underlying rye beers, other than the rye itself. In fact, even the rye can vary. New malts are appearing, such as <a href="http://www.themaltmiller.co.uk/index.php?_a=viewProd&amp;productId=29">crystal rye</a> which give a new flavor dimension to beers - crystal rye provides some of the spiciness of malted rye with dark fruits, and a pleasant dryness in the finish. This means the brewer can make a rye beer from:</p>

<ul>
<li>malted rye</li>
<li>flaked (unmalted) rye</li>
<li>crystal rye</li>
</ul>

<p>Rye is becoming at least as versatile as wheat, if not in fact more so. While most Wheat beers focus on the esters and phenolics produced by the yeast (banana/clove), Rye beers have the freedom to exploit the full spectrum of beer flavors and are not constrained by adherence to a particular style entrenched in tradition. </p>

<p><strong>But will you like some other rye beer having tried one?</strong></p>

<p>If you don''t like the taste of rye in beer, then there''s a good chance you won''t like most rye beers, since the rye flavor is most likely going to be present. However, if you do like the taste of rye, there is still no saying up front that you will like any rye beer simply due to the diversity of beers that can be brewed with rye.</p>

Essentially, beer is a much more complex drink; beer tasters use all of their taste buds while wine drinkers may only use a select few.

<p>If you look at the diagram of the tongue below, you''ll notice that the bitter taste bud receptors are on the back of the tongue. In order to reach these receptors and taste the beer to its fullest, you must swallow the beer.</p>

That does not mean lower alcohol percentage beers can not be aged, but higer percentage beers are more suitable most of the time. </li>
<li><em>Dark Malt:</em> like Palo Santo and World Wide Stout. Darker, maltier beer is better because the sweet, residual sugars tend to soften over time. Even lower-alcohol beers with a malt-heavy profile will age better. </li>
<li><em>Wild Beers:</em> living organisms change the beer as it ages in the bottle. Orval Trappist Ale is a classic example. The Belgian pale ale receives a dose of Brettanomyces yeast as it goes in the bottle. The yeast can live in the bottle for years, slowly consuming sugars and protecting the beer’s existing flavors by consuming oxygen.

<p>Canned/bottled beer has a longer shelf life than keg beer. Canned/bottled beer has a shelf life of roughly 45-60 days, whereas a keg is only 25-40 days <strong><sup><a href="http://www.micromatic.com/beer-questions/how-long-keg-beer-remain-fresh-aid-44.html">1</a></sup></strong>.</p>

<p>This means that worst case scenario for comparison you could be tasting a 2 month old canned beer versus a 3 week old draft. It can cause a difference in taste, there is a "freshness date" after all. (See this <em><a href="http://beer.stackexchange.com/a/502/303">excellent answer from @mdma for more information on what happens as beer ages</a></em>)</p>

<p>But where does this date come from? Almost all imported retail beer is pasteurized. The reason for pasteurizing the beer is from a business standpoint. It basically allows the beer to last longer and be shipped at room temperature (this applies to kegs, cans, and bottles). </p>

<p>An alternative to the pasteurization process is bottle conditioning. Most domestic beers follow this path. Essentially this process involves beers being sterile filtered and chilled to the point that any surviving bacteria, which could ferment the beer, become dormant <strong><sup><a href="http://www.micromatic.com/beer-questions/pasteurized-and-non-pasteurized-keg-beer-aid-45.html">2</a></sup></strong>.</p>

<p>So basically the probability that the beer begins to ferment is higher over time. A canned beer and a keg beer can taste the same if they both left the brewery at the same time, and both experienced the same conditions during the time it took them to reach you. It is just that kegs have a better chance of taking less time and of being better preserved.</p>

<p>From a practical standpoint though, bottles can cause broken glass, kegs weigh close to 50 lbs. full, and cans allow for shotgunning. Make sure your container of choice fits your environment :)</p>

<p>To fully experience the flavor of beer, one must swallow it. This is because, unlike the vast majority of wine, beer is carbonated (albeit to varying degrees). When you swallow beer, some of the carbonation escapes the liquid as gas, and actually rises up from your throat into your nose (or, at least, into your nasal passages), carrying with it some of the flavor molecules of the beer. Thus your sense of smell combines with your sense of taste to produce an overall sense of flavor in a manner that is different from what occurs when you drink (uncarbonated) wine.</p>

<p>(This explanation is based on one that I heard years ago from a brewmaster at Anheuser-Busch. I can''t remember his exact words, but you get the gist.)</p>

<p>On a side note, regarding the important relationship between taste and smell, I''m sure you will see tasters at both beer tastings and especially wine tastings swirl their drink a bit to smell it from the glass before tasting it. The difference is that carbonated beverages pack a smell double-whammy coming at you after you swallow.</p>

<p>While it''s hard to predict the future, we can infer from the past.  As it stands, beer cans as old as 40 years are pretty much worthless (with a few exceptions).  This is because right around the mid 70s, beer can collection as an activity exploded.  Beer cans before that point became valuable, but beer cans from after that point were heavily collected (up through the present day), and are therefore pretty low value.</p>

<p>That''s just the cans, though.  Exceptions might be very specific beers known to be age-able for decades.  Unfortunately, most beers just don''t age that long.  Even a hearty barely wine usually peaks, at most, after a couple years.  The Stone Vertical Epic 020202 series was meant to be aged 10 years, which is unusually long for a beer.</p>

  three or four flakes of Mace, half a pound of Dates; beat these all in

If this definition seems to rule out some rather important airports, we can modify the rules.</p>

<p>This list would probably help me with "tiebreaking" when I can''t decide what flights I''d rather take. It would also give me a reason to enjoy longer-than-desired connections :-)</p>

  <p>Snake Venom is the world’s strongest beer as of 24 October 2013, coming in at 67.5%. It is dark amber in colour with no carbonation due to the high ABV. Unlike the previous Armageddon, the alcohol is not masked in Snake Venom. It is highly present yet it still tastes like a beer with a good degree of hop profile. Each batch is tested by the brewery before bottling and random batches are tested externally.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An alcohol content of 67.5% is not something I would associate with beer. So, why is this considered one and not a spirit?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>an alcoholic beverage made by brewing and fermentation from cereals, usually malted barley, and flavored with hops and the like for a slightly bitter taste.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not a very restrictive definition and would seem to also apply to whisky if you add some hops to it. So, is there a better one? </p>

INSERT INTO post VALUES (591, NULL, NULL, '<p>Snake Venom is beer not a spirit because spirits are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distillation" rel="nofollow">distilled</a>. Beer is technically not distilled. </p>

<p>As the definition you cited says, beer is the product of fermenting sugar derived from cereal grain which is dissolved in water. So water + grain + yeast = beer. The grain has to undergo a saccharification process where the carbohydrate chains (starches) in the grain are transformed into sugar (glucose, fructose, sucrose, maltose...) which is then converted into alcohol by yeast. Fermentable sugar is extracted from barley through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malt" rel="nofollow">malting</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mash_%28beer%29" rel="nofollow">mashing</a>. The yeast is generally added to the <em>wort</em> (unfermented sugary water) manually by the brewer or wild yeast can fall into the beer from the air. </p>

<p>Other processes may be involved with fermenting other grains. For example, in sake brewing, <a href="http://www.themadfermentationist.com/2010/05/making-koji-for-sake.html" rel="nofollow">koji</a> (a type of mold) is grown on rice (and soybeans) before fermentation in order to convert starches into fermentable sugars, as rice does not contain the enzymes needed to convert its starches into sugars (note: sake is generally not consider beer, but there are beers made with significant quantities of rice, up to 100% rice beer is possible).</p>

<p>Hops is not a necessary ingredient in beer, and beer was made for thousands of years before people started adding hops to it. </p>

<p>These strong beers like Snake Venom are generally brewed to this high ABV level through freeze "distillation." This isn''t really distillation, because no heat is involved, so people still call them beers. But this is a concentration process similar to distillation. Alcohol has a lower freezing point than water, so when you freeze beer, you can remove the ice and you''re left with a more concentrated beer. This is the process used in the German eisbock style. The brewers also start with a high ABV beer, using special ingredients (sugar sources other than malt, like table sugar) along with strains of yeast that can tolerate high levels of alcohol and still continue to live and ferment. This process can be somewhat difficult and expensive, so it gets attention. In my opinion it''s a novelty, but I guess people like it, because they sell a lot of it.</p>

<p>Quoting from the <a href="http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/style18.php#1c">Beer Judge Criteria</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Aroma: Complex with moderate to significant spiciness, moderate
  fruity esters and low alcohol and hop aromas. Generous spicy, peppery,
  sometimes clove-like phenols. Esters are often reminiscent of citrus
  fruits such as oranges, but may sometimes have a slight banana
  character. A low yet distinctive spicy, floral, sometimes perfumy hop
  character is usually found. Alcohols are soft, spicy and low in
  intensity. No hot alcohol or solventy aromas. The malt character is
  light. No diacetyl.</p>
  
  <p>Appearance: Deep yellow to deep gold in color. Good clarity.
  Effervescent. Long-lasting, creamy, rocky, white head resulting in
  characteristic “Belgian lace” on the glass as it fades.</p>
  
  <p>Flavor: Marriage of spicy, fruity and alcohol flavors supported by a
  soft malt character. Low to moderate phenols are peppery in character.
  Esters are reminiscent of citrus fruit such as orange or sometimes
  lemon. A low to moderate spicy hop character is usually found.
  Alcohols are soft, spicy, often a bit sweet and low in intensity.
  Bitterness is typically medium to high from a combination of hop
  bitterness and yeast-produced phenolics. Substantial carbonation and
  bitterness lends a dry finish with a moderately bitter aftertaste. No
  diacetyl.</p>
  
  <p>Mouthfeel: Medium-light to medium body, although lighter than the
  substantial gravity would suggest (thanks to sugar and high
  carbonation). High alcohol content adds a pleasant creaminess but
  little to no obvious warming sensation. No hot alcohol or solventy
  character. Always effervescent. Never astringent.</p>
  
  <p>Overall Impression: Strongly resembles a Strong Golden Ale but
  slightly darker and somewhat fuller-bodied. Usually has a more rounded
  malt flavor but should not be sweet.</p>
  
  <p>Comments: High in alcohol but does not taste strongly of alcohol. The
  best examples are sneaky, not obvious. High carbonation and
  attenuation helps to bring out the many flavors and to increase the
  perception of a dry finish. Most Trappist versions have at least 30
  IBUs and are very dry. Traditionally bottle-conditioned (“refermented
  in the bottle”).</p>
  
  <p>History: Originally popularized by the Trappist monastery at
  Westmalle.</p>
  
  <p>Ingredients: The light color and relatively light body for a beer of
  this strength are the result of using Pilsner malt and up to 20% white
  sugar. Noble hops or Styrian Goldings are commonly used. Belgian yeast
  strains are used – those that produce fruity esters, spicy phenolics
  and higher alcohols – often aided by slightly warmer fermentation
  temperatures. Spice additions are generally not traditional, and if
  used, should not be recognizable as such. Fairly soft water.</p>

Some beers, such as real ale (or cask ale) are served at cellar temperature, which while certainly above the temperature of a beer fresh out a refrigerator, at 12-14 degrees celsius (53-57F) is still much colder than room temperature.  </p>

<p><strong>To answer your question:</strong>  Mulled beer <strong>is</strong> heated beer.  As with wine, mulled beer is usually warmed over a low stove or in a crockpot with spices, often including cinnamon, nutmeg, citrus zest, and a sweetener like brown sugar, but it doesn''t <em>need</em> to include any additional ingredients, particularly if it already has strong spice or fruit characteristics.  So, any beer style that you heat is, in fact, mulled beer.     </p>

<p>As to styles of beer that would be suitable for mulling, Belgian Strong Dark ales would be good candidates, as would nice fruity lambics.   Barleywine ales, milk stouts, chocolate stouts, and oatmeal stouts I would imagine might also be nice.  The characteristics I''d look for would be a heavy body, more malty than hoppy, a bit of sweetness, and if present, dark fruit (plumbs, figs, raisins) or berries.   </p>

Both Dubbel and Tripel as name were first used by the Trappist brewery of Westmalle.</p>

<p>Westmalle produced the first dark beer in 1856 named "Dubbel" (the recipe was changed in 1926). Dubbels are dark in color, and tend to have malt flavors dominating over hops. Whereas the Quadrupels have more of a fruit presence, the Dubbels tend to be a bit spicier with strong caramel flavors. They tend to have an ABV of 6.5-9.0%.</p>

<p>Some examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>Chimay Red</li>
<li>La Trappe Dubbel</li>
<li>Ommegang</li>
<li>Westvleteren 8 </li>
<li>Rochefort 6</li>
<li>Westmalle Dubbel</li>
</ul>

<p>Tripels are lighter color, often blonde. They are generally a lot fruitier and lighter in flavor.

Before the discovery/invention of force carbonation methods, all beer was carbonated naturally via bottle or cask conditioning.

Their vessels probably could not have withstood the pressure of carbonation even if they were using wax or cork to seal the vessels.</p>

<p>So if you were to brew a historical style and you wanted to be truly accurate, then you would not carbonate it. But the modern historical interpretations usually are carbonated (like <a href="http://www.dogfish.com/ancientales" rel="nofollow">Dogfish Head''s ancient ales</a>), because they are selling them and Westerners generally prefer them :)</p>

<p>As the other answers indicate, there are no "modern styles" (e.g. <a href="http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/catdex.php" rel="nofollow">styles you''d find in the BJCP style guide</a>), that have <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=gYVLHMmplRcC&amp;pg=PA221&amp;lpg=PA221&amp;dq=oxford%20beer%20companion%20carbonation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MGgbsp_cV7&amp;sig=34ClGqwJYwLtNhACLrhsw7Ot8Zc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=itX_Ut-2PKPWyQG5m4DQDw&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=oxford%20beer%20companion%20carbonation&amp;f=false" rel="nofollow">no carbonation</a>, but several have little or low carbonation, (e.g. barleywine) mentioned in other answers. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahti" rel="nofollow">Sahti</a> also has very little carbonation.</p>

<p>Beer flavor changes over time (hops fade away, oxidation takes hold, etc.), and this process happens more quickly at warmer temperatures than colder ones. But there are no additional chemical reactions caused by temperature changes, so warming to room temperature and re-chilling multiple times is not going to have any added effects on the beer. Assuming you are drinking it within a few weeks, you won''t notice the difference with bottled or canned beer.</p>

<p>I think this myth took hold from left-over kegs after parties: A half-empty keg that was dispensed by pumping air into it will start to oxidize much more quickly since oxygen is being added to it. When it warms the oxidation speeds up and it tastes stale within a day or two. Keeping it cold slows that down a bit, but even cold it won''t last very long. A keg being dispensed using CO2 is a different story: that will last as long as bottled beer and can be warmed and rechilled without ill effects.</p>

<p>In all of this, I am referring to room temperature. Beer left in a car in the sun for hours will start to stale much more quickly, even if bottles are protected from the sunlight. You won''t get the skunky flavor caused by the light, but it will taste stale.</p>

The style was most likely originated at Westmalle in the mid 19th Century.  While Trappist abbeys tend to be the origin and driver of the style, many secular Belgian breweries produce them as Abbey beers which may have actually been a brewing monastery at one point or simply as a Dubbel.  They''re not as popular amongst American brewers as triples though.</p>

<p>As far as flavor profile, it''s a malty but dry beer.  The Belgian abbey yeast strains will ferment the beer fairly dry but will create a whole host of fruity esters and spicy phenols that will add to the mid range caramel malts.  Many of the Trappist versions have attenuation of 80%-90%.  Westmalle Dubbel, Chimay Red Label, New Belgium Abbey, St. Martin Brune are all good examples of the style.</p>

<p>With regards to AudiFanatic''s answer, In this case, Beer Advocate is wrong in their description of a Triple. Triples do NOT use 3x''s the malt as a Single.  No brewer will tell you that, nor is it true historically.  Malt extraction is linear, meaning 3x''s the malt will be 3x''s the alcohol.  The closest you get to that is historically when the single was the 3rd running (like a small beer). With this method, the 1st run had triple the fermentables extracted than the 3rd run.</p>

<p>And while I may only be a blogger, with 13 years of industry experience, I spoke with highly trained brewmasters and read references written by authoritative experts.  I''m pretty sure my answer article is more accurate than the Beer Advocate''s, in this case.  Also, the flavor profile of a triple does not have "flavors similar" to a dubbel.  Dark malt and light malt will give very different flavors. The only Triple that has similar flavor is Stift Engelzell''s triple, which is a unique dark triple, as they''re labeling it.</p>

<p>Since hops are the primary contributor to bitterness in beer, high IBU beers also tend to be hoppy (although that''s not always the case, since hops added at certain points in the brewing process contribute mostly to bitterness, while hops added at other points contribute mostly to hop aroma and flavor).</p>

<p>As an aside, heavier beers (specifically, those with lots of malt) will taste less bitter than a lighter beer with the same IBU.  To elaborate:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>there is still the complication that IBUs do not really correlate with perceived bitterness because other aspects of beer affect the perception of bitterness. For example, two beers containing 25 IBUs will be perceived very different with respect to bitterness if one beer had an O.G. of 10 °Plato and finished at 1.5 °Plato and the other beer had an O.G. of 12.5 °Plato and finished at 2.5 °Plato. Begin varying the malt bill by adding crystal malt, for example, and changing the content of various water salts and things become even muddier. This is the reason that measures like the IBU are extremely useful when used within a population of similar beers, but not so handy when looking at very different populations.

  <p>The origins of the yard of ale date back to the early 17th century, during the reign of King James I (1603-1625). Glass-making in England was then in its infancy; the first glass-making factory had only recently been established. Many of the first yard glasses have not survived due to their brittle nature, until George Ravenscroft (1674) introduced a new glass process known as the flint glass.</p>
  
  <p>The yard of ale was made and used not for normal drinking purposes, but for feast and manly displays of prowess. During Anglo-Saxon times through the Middle Ages, the English nation has always engaged in the traditions of heavy drinking. As put in Young’s quote “England’s Bane” written in 1617, “He is a man of no fashion that can not drink by the dozen, by the yard, so by measure we drink out of measure.”</p>
  
  <p>Legend suggests that the yard was also used in old England to serve the driver of a coach. Upon arriving at their destination and relieving its passengers, the coachman would stay and the length of the yard glass would allow him some refreshment.</p>

<p>I''m certain that most of the history of using this style of vessel comes from fellow drinkers trying to show each other up at parties, but aside from the sheer volume (and perhaps limitations of glass-making artisans), how did this length and volume of the glass first come about?  Is there more definitive evidence for the year of birth of the yard, besides the milestone in their history of the introduction of flint glass? </p>

<p>I''m also curious about whether the volume of the glass was satisfying to stagecoach drivers because of their need to wait long periods for their passenger, or whether it was just easier to hand them a tall glass as they remained in the seat. </p>

Unfortunately, they seem to have turned up nothing definitive.</p>

<p>On one point, the post is quite consistent: there isn''t any real evidence to suggest that the story of the stagecoach or mailcoach driver drinking from the yard-glass is true. </p>

<p>It mentions sources on the history of glassmakers:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The same absence of evidence occurs in specialist books on drinking glasses. The history  of the Worshipful Company of Glass Sellers, published in 1898, has a drawing of the Eton  “long glass”, but no coach drivers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And also the history of coaches:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Specialist books on coach travel also fail to supply references to coach drivers and ale-yards.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The coach explanation appears to be wholly made-up:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The earliest reference to the coach driver legend I have found is from 1952</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And, inferring from previous evidence provided by the author, this is almost a century after coach travel has been superseded by steam trains.</p>

<p>The author also makes an interesting point; a coach driver was almost certainly <em>not</em> handed a yard of ale from the alehouse window, because the risk of breaking the glass (which would have been expensive) was too great!</p>

<p>Most of the evidence of the post tends to suggest that the yard of ale was originally intended as a bit of a joke, and attempting to drink the whole thing without spilling a drop was a fun game to play.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When air reaches the bulb it displaces the liquor with a splash, startling the toper, and compelling him involuntarily to withdraw his mouth by the rush of the cold liquid over his face and dress.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To summarise, in one final quote from the most-excellent article:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But with all that, I hope you’ll agree, we have found no evidence that
  the yard of ale was originally “designed to meet the needs of
  stagecoach drivers” in a hurry. In fact, there is no evidence that the
  yard of ale was ever used to refresh coach drivers at all (and if it
  had been, it certainly wouldn’t have been handed up to the driver
  through an inn window, which would be an excellent way to either spill
  the ale or smash the glass). Instead, I think, it seems clear that the
  yard of ale was (1) produced as something of a show-off, for the
  glassmaker and the owner, and (2) primarily or almost solely supplied
  and bought as a “forfeit glass”, for use in drinking games and
  contests of skill, just as it is today.</p>

INSERT INTO post VALUES (646, NULL, NULL, '<p>First, let me state that I''m a 4th generation Italian American; I know nothing about Russian customs other than what I learned in a Russian history class (humanities requirement) a few semesters ago. With that said, I could probably shoot an email to the professor who I took the class with if you want more info, but I think my answer will suffice (but please let me know, he is a pretty cool guy).</p>

<p>Anyway, I would presume it has something to do with Russian culture and the importance of honey in that part of the world. I remember when I was a kid (like 2nd  grade I think), we read a collection of short, non-fiction stories of a Russian girl and her grandfather, who was a beekeeper. I cannot remember what the name of the book was nor the author nor whether or not the stories took before or during the Soviet era; but I do remember that honey played a really important role in most of the stories.  </p>

<p>Of course there is other more concrete evidence other than my childhood reading material. For instance, just take a look at Russian cuisine. They have a mead-like beverage called <a href="http://russiapedia.rt.com/of-russian-origin/medovukha/" rel="nofollow">Medovukha</a>, which is made with honey and yeast. It''s apparently a traditional drink at weddings over there. Also, you''ve got Russian honey cakes and <a href="http://russian.lingualift.com/blog/honey-tradition-russia/" rel="nofollow">other food based items</a>. Finally, honey is also a good preservative as it''s antibacterial, so it was often mixed in with jams back in the day to preserve them. </p>

<p>So I''d be surprised if many of the ex-soviet brewers didn''t use honey as an additive to their beer. Especially if the beers you have in mind are bottle conditioned, they would need to add a sweetener of sorts for proper carbonation. I''ve used honey in two of my home brews and I like it.</p>

<hr>

<p>Perhaps some substantiating points:</p>

<ul>
<li>Baltika Medovoe Light seems to be a popular "first Russian beer" to try. It''s a pale lager with natural honey added.</li>
<li><p>Indeed honey does seem to have played a central role in Russian culture.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Like the Assumption, the three "Saviors" (<em>Spas</em>), August 1, 6, and 16, were associated with the fruits of the earth. The first was called the "Honey" (<em>medovyi</em>) or "Wet Savior" (<em>mokryi Spas</em>), signifying either the gathering of honey or the religious procession and blessing of the waters traditional for this day.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>According to Russian historian Vasili Kliuchevskii (1841–1911), we must learn about the Russian forest, river and steppe in order to understand the Russian people. [...] "The forest provided the Russian with oak and pine to build his house, it warmed him with aspen and birch, it lit his hut with birchwood splinters, it shod him in birch bast sandals, it gave him plates and dishes, clothed him in hides and furs and fed him honey. The forest was the best shelter from his enemies."</p>

<p>So, though still conjecture, it may be so that Russian culture has had a higher demand for honey notes in their foods and beverages, naturally selecting those tastes.</p>

To summarize, lambics are exposed to wild yeast (rather than the usual cultivated yeasts) and tend to have a dry, tart taste.  These are not heavy-bodied beers, nor are they bitter.  (Hops are used for their preservative effect, but old, dry hops are used to minimize the flavor impact.)</p>

<p>Frequently, lambics (like the one you had) have fruit added later in fermentation.  Common fruits for this include raspberry, peach, and cherry, and I''ve also encountered apple.  The sweetness you''re tasting probably comes from the fruit (and some of these varieties taste sweeter to me than others).  If you''d like to try a lambic that doesn''t have the fruit, which is likely to be less sweet, look for "gueuze".</p>

<p>In Belgium it''s not a style. It''s merely a label to mark that more ingredient were used, comparatively with the other beers within the same brewery.
A little history:
The ingredients to make beer were expensive in the middle ages, so the brewers tried to use as little as possible for there beer. There was however also an market for more tasteful, more expensive, beer. To differentiate between the brewed barrels they used X for the cheap bear, XX for the expensive one. Not saying that there were double the ingredients in it, just more. Later came also XXX. You can still find these X''s on some labels these days.
The name Triple is a more recent appellation (1930''s), but it is based on the same idea.
A classic trio you find in Belgium, but with a lot of exceptions, is a blond(X), a brown (XX, double) and a strong blond ale (XXX, triple). These are relative references, within the brewery and like already mentioned, more ingredients, not doubling or tripling the amount of ingredients. Making the beers stronger in alcohol and taste.</p>

  <p>Beyond issues of distribution, the joint legislative committee also heard from industry members interested in allowing both on- and off-premise retailers to fill beer containers up to 64 ounces for take-away and off-site consumption. The bill, sponsored by Representative William Pignatelli, has caused some division in the industry between retailers and small brewers. “We think it would be a disaster for our business by cannibalizing our bottle sales, our only real income source,” says one small Massachusetts brewer. “We for one couldn''t thrive in a situation where the profit on bottled beer transfers from brewery to store or bar.”</p>

What I do know however: Chimay is one of the largest Trappist brewers so it''s not that weird that it''s widely available. With hundreds (thousands!) of beers in Belgium, Chimay is a popular beer, but far from the most popular. I think that''s the reason why they can sell a lot abroad.
Also a fact, beers like Westvleteren (that won a lot of prizes) are even in Belgium (where it is brewed) pretty rare and hard to get. Basically you have to go to the Abbey yourself to get some beer. If you''re there, you only get ONE crate (6 beers) per person. I was lucky enough to visit Westvleteren a while ago and found out that in the nearby cafe you also could buy one crate per person, however there were only about 100 crates available that day and only one type was available. You can drink all types though by ordering it to drink in the café (3 types).
If you would ever want to taste Westvleteren but cannot find it, Sint-Bernardus Abt 12 is a very similar beer. I''ve heard that it is brewn exactly the same way but with some slight differences.</p>

For example, Chimay put up <a href="http://www.chimay.com/en/art-of-brewing.html?IDC=284" rel="nofollow">a series of short video clips</a> that take us through surprisingly up-to-date facilities capable of bottling up to 40,000 bottles a day! (Probably it''s just my own prejudices—associating monks and monasteries with old times, thus old technologies—causing surprise in my case.) With many other competing beers, and demand checked by relatively higher prices, the abbey alone suffices.</p>

<p>The volume produced, according to <a href="http://marketsmedia.com/chimay-turns-150-week-manchester-pub-nyc-celebrates/" rel="nofollow">this 2012 article</a>, is 120,000 hectoliters of beer annually, or 16,000,000 bottles (750 mL) of beer. To put this in some perspective, according to <a href="http://celebrator.com/archives/2007/12/gh_belgianbeer.html" rel="nofollow">this 2008 article</a> St. Bernardus at the time was exporting to 20 countries and producing 13,000 hectoliters (considerably lesser than Chimay) annually. And as @ValentinGregoire started saying, Westvleteren is difficult to find because the monks of the abbey of Saint Sixtus decided not to increase production despite the beer''s popularity, and thus produce only 4,800 hectoliters according to a 2005 publication.</p>

<p>For me, it''s hard to grasp such large numbers in any meaningful way. I looked up Stella Artois'' production figures (and not because it''s Belgian—it was just the first popular, global beer to come to mind), and found that in 2012 they produced a little over 10,000,000 hectoliters that year. Divide that by Chimay''s 120,000 hectoliters per annum. Can I believe that 83 units of Stella are being consumed for every 1 equivalent unit of Chimay? Meant only as a sanity check and not any rigorous argument, it checks out as believable to me—after all, Stella''s on draught all over the U.S. (I can''t speak for other countries but I''m sure everywhere else too).</p>

INSERT INTO post VALUES (696, NULL, NULL, '<p>From what I understand, Shandies as we see them now are more similar to the German Radler.  Radler means cyclist in German.  The way I understand the story is that a small pub owner was besieged one day by a slew of thirsty cyclists and knew that his beer supply wouldn''t hold out, so he cut it by mixing it with some sort of lemon drink he had on hand.  As far as I know this origin story isn''t confirmed and Radler likely grew out of folk attempts to "sessionize" and extend the supply of leftover lager through the summer when lower alcohol and more refreshing drinks were wanted.  According to wikipedia the first printed mention of Radler as a drink was in 1912: <a href="http://gutenberg.spiegel.de/buch/4594/20">http://gutenberg.spiegel.de/buch/4594/20</a>  I believe contemporary Radlers use a lemon-soda sort of drink that''s more like a carbonated lemonade than what we''d think of as soda.</p>

<p>Shandy itself is short for Shandygaff which is a British English term from the mid-1800s referring to beer cut with ginger beer or ginger ale. In fact, the OED still defines it as such while Mariam-Webster has loosened it up and allows for any non-alcoholic drink to be used in place of ginger.</p>

<p>As to their reputation, if you''ll forgive me a little supposition, most commercial shandies are very pale duplications of mixing lemonade (or lemon soda) with a beer yourself.  The first commercial example I saw was Lienenkugel''s and it was abusively sweet.  Sam Adams and The Traveler have fared a little better, but I think a major problem is that to commercially produce a shandy you need to heavily filter and pasteurize the beer and lemonade  to make sure the sugar doesn''t ferment or use a non-fermentable sugar, which would change the taste from fresh beer and fresh lemonade.  At the scale a lot of breweries operate at, it possible some of them aren''t even using real lemonade regardless of sugar type.  Also, while continuously popular in Europe, beer cocktails never caught on or were lost in America and we tend to think of them now as marketing gimmicks by macro-brewers (Bud Light Lime, Bud Chelada, Miller Chill), though as they become more visible, I think they''ll become more accepted.</p>

<p>That said, fresh shandy is incredible, I like using wheat beer.</p>

<p>The actual answer has more to do with yeast content than carbonation.  Unfiltered beers like real ale have much more yeast in suspension, and yeast has a tendency to make you gassy when digested.  Lager in general has very little yeast due to the long, cold, aging process.  I believe commercial examples are filtered as well.  In general most commercial beers are filtered, or at least have had the yeast killed off somehow, which mitigates the effect.  Real ale''s major selling points are that it''s unpasteurized and unfiltered, and is refermented in the cask...so it''s basically got way more yeast and way more active yeast than other kinds of beer.  And then cask ales are served from a tap at the front near the bottom...near the yeast.  Basically the perfect storm of fart-induction.</p>

German-style lagers are almost exclusively recommended to be served no lower than 6C no higher than 9C, but I often find that the last (and warmest) mouthfuls from a glass actually have the most flavour - but I would always start with the lager cold when possible.</p>

<p>Real ales are a different story. On the continent of Europe there still seems to be a myth that British drink their beer ''luke-warm'', but if served at that temperature most Brits would complain (and maybe continue to drink it while complaining). I believe the phrase ''serve cool'' rather than ''cold'' applies. Some live, bottled beers actually suffer from being too cold. On of my favourites, Black Sheep Ale develops a ''chill haze'' - going a little cloudy if left in the fridge too long. 13C is about right for such beers.

<ol>
<li>As you suspect, the bowl shaped glass helps to concentrate the aroma.  However, this isn''t unique to the snifter as many types of beer glasses incorporate a narrowing throat to provide this effect. </li>
<li>Quantity.  With a glass of beer that has a particularly high alcohol content, or particularly strong flavor, you''ll often get much less than a standard 12-16 oz. pour.  The beer you refer to for instance, the Big Bad Baptist, has an alcohol content of 11.8% ABV, which closer to wine than beer, (and wine has a standard 5oz serving size per glass, or thereabouts) so it calls for a smaller serving size.  However, a 5oz or 6oz serving would look rather silly in a pint glass, so a snifter is more appropriate in proportion. </li>

<ol>
<li>You can call and make an appointment and IF you get an
appointment then you must drive there at the appointed time to pick
up your crate of bier. If you can''t make it at the appointed time
then you lose out, and you must start the process all over again. I
forget how much bier this is for, but I think it is 24-48 bottles. Indeed when you make the appointment then you must supply your license place number which they use to keep track of you. They will not allow you to make 2 appointments with the same license plate number in a 60 day period. Additionally, the phone number you must call to get an appointment is always busy, I have heard of people using automatic redial for hours before they finally get through. </li>
<li>If you are in the area (again you will need a car, because there is no public transport, and biking there is unreasonable from most places.) You can pop in and there is a small shop next to the monastery where you can buy a 6 pack per person without appointment, and also with out a huge price markup. Of course while you are there you can also eat some good food, and buy other items that the monks make and sell. This is much less hassle, but you cannot get much bier, so it may not be worth trekking all the way out there specifically for this.  However if you are in the area already and you have the time to take a small detour then you should certainly pop in for lunch or dinner and get some tasty brew.</li>
<li>Finally if you are in the Benelux region you can sometimes find Westvleteren in local shops or cafes, however the prices range from 10-16 euros per bottle (in Amsterdam) which is a lot more than you will pay at the monastery. (However, beer bought at the monastery isn''t meant for selling, it''s meant for private consumption, it says so every time you buy some)</li>

The Sint Bernardus Abt 12 is basically for sale throughout whole Belgium in every big grocery store (or beer/drink shop).</p>

<p>In addition to the abbey, you can also buy the beer in the café/restaurant nearby. However, depending which beer is left over, that beer will be for sale and you can only buy 1 pack of 6 bottles per person (if there would be any left!).
You could also just go there and sit and enjoy a Westvleteren there because they sell them there :).
You could also buy glasses and some other souvenirs at the café. They have a little shop.</p>

Most popular with everyone I know is home-made strawberry wine, but plum wine is a favourite, too, and any berry or fruit is used, with every family that owns a garden making one or two bottles of these fruit wines each autumn.</p>

<p>Apples are different because we grow so much more of them than strawberries or plums, and they are regularly pressed into apple juice in large quantities by the fruit grower cooperatives that sell it to the beverage industry. If you don''t pasteurize the juice (for long term stability), it turns alcoholic after a couple of days, and after the apple harvest everyone gets large cannisters of freshly pressed juice from the cooperative presses, bakes onion tarts ("Dinnele"), and eats and drinks this seasonal speciality, with more or less alcohol, depending on taste.</p>

<p>"Most" (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Must" rel="nofollow">must</a>) or "Süßmost" (sweet must) is freshly pressed juice; once it has turned alcoholic (and sour) it has different names in different areas, such as "Sauermost" (sour must) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apfelwein" rel="nofollow">Apfelwein</a> (apple wine).</p>

<p>Within southern Germany and Austria, Frankfurt is not specifically famous for apple wine, the drink, because it is drunk elsewhere, too. What the region around Frankfurt is somewhat well-known for are the festivities surrounding the end of the apple harvest and the pressing of apple juice, which have been the background theme for a musical tv show, <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zum_Blauen_Bock" rel="nofollow">Zum Blauen Bock</a> (The Blue Goat Buck), that ran from 1957 to 1987.

<p>Anyway, what length are the beer lines?  Generally you need to balance CO2 pressure against beer lines to avoid consistently foamy pours.  If your system isn''t properly balanced the beer will always be foamy, on every pour.  I have 5-6 foot lines in my kegerator and it works pretty well for me, when I was having foamy pour problems everyone suggested replacing them with 10 foot lines just to make damn sure the pour wasn''t too violent.  Also making sure the lines are clean.  Any beer stone or other sediment in the lines is going to cause foam.</p>

<p>Serving warmer with lower CO2 would also be a better step.  One frustrating thing about these sorts of adjustments is that it takes time for equilibrium to be hit.  So if you lower the CO2 pressure, the headspace is still pressurize.  You''ll need to vent the keg via the pressure release valve.  Same deal with raising the temperature.  Once the beer actually comes up to the new temp, there will have been CO2 driven out of solution that you need to vent from the headspace via the pressure release valve.  It''s a pain.  Regulators will also often have their own pressure valve, which you should poke and vent slightly when setting the pressure...especially when coming down since excess pressure in the system is going to mess with the reading.  So vent, watch it rise to the actual pressure, then adjust, vent again, and watch.  It takes some time but generally once you set it there''s very little change required.</p>

<p>It''s hard to tell without seeing the speed of your pour.</p>

<p>Definitely check the keg temperature itself.  As a homebrewer I reuse kegs, so I have stickers on all my kegs that have a little temperature line.  These liquid crystal thermometers, like <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00026Z4PS" rel="nofollow" title="this one">this one</a>, are pretty cheap.</p>

<p>You can also check the ambient temperature using a regular thermometer and a small glass of water.  You should check temperature at multiple spots inside the kegerator, so you could fill some tumblers or shot glasses with water and place them at the bottom of the kegerator, then maybe on top of the keg, and then maybe a back shelf if you have anything like that.  This lets you know if you have any hot spots which you can reduce by reorganizing tubes or tossing a small computer case fan in there.</p>

<p>Also, if you haven''t disabled the dome light in the fridge, do so or find some way to make sure the switch stays down beyond a doubt.  When I first built my kegerator I was getting incredibly foamy pours and a huge contributor wound up being the dome light kept coming on and heating up the tops of the kegs and the beer in my lines.</p>

<p>Another final check is the temperature inside of the tower.  If you have no way for the cold air to get from the body of the fridge into the tower the lines in the tower will get warm and cause foamy beer, though if the CO2 pressure is set correctly, this would likely only result in the first 1-2 pours being foamy, then it calms down until the lines warm back up.  A lot of people will put fans or run copper tubes up the towers.  I filled mine with insulation.</p>

Past about 100 IBUs the tongue straight up can''t tell that there are any more.  Now we perceive the quality of bitterness differently.</p>

<p>So bitterness in beer is provided primarily by adding hops and boiling them for a long time.  The length of time and pH of the wort affects a chemical reaction called "Isomerization", which is the process by which Alpha Acids in hop oils become Iso-Alpha Acids which stay stably in solution and make beer taste bitter.</p>

<p>Similarly, there are also Beta Acids.  Generally these are in 1:1 ratio with the Alpha acids but sometimes there are more or less depending on the hop types.</p>

<p>Beta Acids are chemically Lupulones and Alpha Acids are Humulones.  We''ve identified 3 types of each as well: No prefix, Co-, and Ad-.  Most homebrewing hop packets list total alpha acid %, then % of those acids that are Cohumulone.  But straight IBUs don''t take which acids were used to get to that number.</p>

<p>Humulone is thought to give the best, smoothest, most pleasing bitterness.  Cohumulone can be pretty abrasive, and the bitterness may seem rougher or more astringent...or just more bitter, even at the same IBUs.  Beta acids are also thought of as a "rough" bitterness, but they primarily produce bitterness via oxidation and can help long term shelf-stability.</p>

<p>I don''t know what all this really helps to answer, but I guess the main points are that you can''t taste past 100 IBUs, but there are qualities to bitterness that can make some beers more abusive than others.  Also my final point is that hop flavor and aroma don''t make a beer bitter.  If the hops have been boiled enough to actually make a beer that bitter...you do not taste those hops.  You can have hoppy beers that are smooth and not bitter at all by hop selection, yeast selection, dry hopping, and not boiling them hops very much.  You can also make beer more bitter by yeast selection and certain grains.  You can also make Ruination or Palate Wrecker, but the point is that hoppiness and bitterness are not the same thing.</p>

The two main "aproaches" are to extract the alcohl afterwards or just don''t allow the generation of it.

The extracting part can be achived by filtering and reverse osmosis. Alcohl and water are getting sucked out and the "beer mass" gets re-watered. These steps may affect the taste quit a bit. A few brewers (especially in Germany) have developed a "top secret" technique to brew a alchol free beer which tasts the same as "normal" beer - but most of these are "top secret".

Latest science experiements revealed a new way of brewing alcohl free beer, by just stopping the fermentation process. This can be done by lowering the temperature of the liquid containers.

Beers brewed with this technique tend to taste more sweet.

Both method have their up and downs so a couple brewers combinded both: Less fermentation then usal and extracting the extra bits of alcohol.', 10);

Ale yeasts are generally regarded as top-fermenting yeasts since they rise to the surface during fermentation, creating a very thick, rich yeast head. That is why the term "top-fermenting" is associated with ale yeasts. Fermentation by ale yeasts at these relatively warmer temperatures produces a beer high in esters, which many regard as a distinctive character of ale beers. 

Top-fermenting yeasts are used for brewing ales, porters, stouts, Altbier, Kölsch, and wheat beers. *

Lager yeast strains are best used at temperatures ranging from 7 to 15°C. At these temperatures, lager yeasts grow less rapidly than ale yeasts, and with less surface foam they tend to settle out to the bottom of the fermenter as fermentation nears completion. This is why they are often referred to as "bottom" yeasts. The final flavour of the beer will depend a great deal on the strain of lager yeast and the temperatures at which it was fermented. 

Some of the lager styles made from bottom-fermenting yeasts are Pilsners, Dortmunders, Märzen, Bocks, and American malt liquors.*

The two main "approaches" are to extract the alcohol afterwards or just don''t allow the generation of it.

The extracting part can be achieved by filtering and reverse osmosis. Alcohol and water are getting sucked out and the "beer mass" gets re-watered. These steps may affect the taste quit a bit. A few brewers (especially in Germany) have developed a "top secret" technique to brew a alcohol free beer which tastes the same as "normal" beer - but most of these are "top secret".

Latest science experiements revealed a new way of brewing alcohol free beer, by just stopping the fermentation process. This can be done by lowering the temperature of the liquid containers.

Beers brewed with this technique tend to taste more sweet.

Both method have their up and downs so a couple brewers combined both: Less fermentation than usual and extracting the extra bits of alcohol.', 12);

For instance if you refrigerate all of your beers and then pull them out of the fridge and drink them instantly you will miss A LOT of the flavor complexity of pretty much every stout and porter you put to your lips.

But, if you let the dark stuff warm up for just 15 minutes before you drink it (let it sit at room temp) a bunch of new flavors will appear that you never would have noticed otherwise.

This doesn''t work so well, in my experience, for lighter beers like pilsner, lager, or hefe-weisen.  They really are meant to be drank cold and letting them get warm changes their flavor profile for the worse.

Obviously there will always be personal preferences but, at a minimum I encourage you to try letting your darker beers warm up just a bit and see what a positive difference it makes.

Here is a temp guide from [ratebeer.com][1] that categorizes different beers based on temps to serve at.  These are basic rules of thumb and again you''ll want to experiment and discover what temps you like your beers at the best.

Force carbonation - This is where CO2 is forced into the fermented beer. Because of the pressure (and the temperature at which it is done) the CO2 will dissolve into the beer solution. The fizz that happens when you open a beer is the CO2 coming out of solution. (Technically you can re-carbonate flat beer!)

Natural carbonation - All beer has SOME yeast present. Home-brewers that bottle will actually pour a little bit of sugar into the racked beer before bottling. The yeast that is present will re-activate and eat the sugar. One of the bi-products is CO2. Because the beer is bottled and the CO2 has nowhere to go, it will dissolve into solution. This is why you will often see little yeast cakes in the bottom of home-brewer''s bottles.

There are some beers that used forced-nitrogen to nitrogenate (if that is the appropriate word) their beers.

One theory begins in 1722 when Ralph Harwood, a London brewer, created a beer called *Entire*.  For some time, working folk had been drinking a blend of beer, ale, and strong beer, which pubs would mix to balance out their stocks and maintain acceptable flavor.  

Entire was a pre-mixed version, brewed by Hardwood then sold and delivered to pubs.  Prior to this point, each pub had mixed their own.  In addition to economies of scale, Harwood''s method allowed for aging of the finished product.  Historians theorize that the name *porter* came about because of the porters who worked at the markets and delivered the final product to the pubs.  A variation of this theory suggests that *porter* simply refers to the working class occupations of those who drank the concoction.

Another theory suggests that *porter* comes from the Netherlands, where a beer called *poorter* was being made as early as the 1300s.  The Dutch were prolific traders, and cultural transfer could easily have occurred.  The term *poorter* originally concerned inhabitants of walled cities and may also have been related to social station.

One theory begins in 1722 when Ralph Harwood, a London brewer, created a beer called *Entire*.  For some time, working folk had been drinking a blend of beer, ale, and strong beer, which pubs would mix to balance out their stocks and maintain acceptable flavor.  

*Entire* was a pre-mixed version, brewed by Hardwood then sold and delivered to pubs.  Prior to this point, each pub had mixed their own.  In addition to economies of scale, Harwood''s method allowed for aging of the finished product.  Historians theorize that the name *porter* came about because of the porters who worked at the markets and delivered the final product to the pubs.  A variation of this theory suggests that *porter* simply refers to the working class occupations of those who drank the concoction.

Another theory suggests that *porter* comes from the Netherlands, where a beer called *poorter* was being made as early as the 1300s.  The Dutch were prolific traders, and cultural transfer could easily have occurred.  The term *poorter* originally concerned inhabitants of walled cities and may also have been related to social station.

They told me that the key difference in that time period was that ale didn''t use (much?) hops.  There were no leftovers.

First, a stronger (higher ABV) beer will tend to cellar better, as the alcohol can act to help prevent oxidization.

Second, a beer with less emphasis on hops, and more on malt, yeast, or other characteristics, will be a better candidate, because the qualities that hops impart will fade in a fairly short time.  This is why your IPAs and such should be consumed sooner than later -- the character is primarily in the hops.

The purpose of cellaring a beer is to see its improvement over time.  Some may stay exactly the same, which others will change.

Bottle fermentation or bottle-conditioning is adding yeast to the bottle at bottling time, so that the beer continues to ferment in the bottle.

I think most brewers do any conditioning before they sell their product, so you don''t have to do this yourself unless you''re homebrewing.

> Ethanol becomes more soluble when whiskey is diluted and cooled, this promotes release of ***flavour molecules***

I think this theory is applicable to beer, but with a few caveats; firstly, beer is already diluted and doesn''t need any more water added; secondly, the alcohol content of beer is much lower than that of whiskey, so not as much cooling would be required.

In particular, "normal" hopping is when you add hops while boiling the wort.  Depending on how much time you are into the boil, this may add more bitterness or more aroma.

Dry hopping, on the other hand, is when you add hops _after_ the boil is done, usually in a fermentation chamber.  The purpose is only to add more aroma to a beer.  You aren''t getting the oils from the hops, so the beer shouldn''t be any more bitter than before.  Because no bitterness is added, you won''t find a beer that is strictly dry-hopped -- the bitterness of the hops is what cuts the sweetness of the wort.  Dry hopping is an extra twist that some brewers use.

All that said, is there a way to tell whether a beer is dry-hopped or just extra hoppy?  That''s hard to say, since you certainly can add more hops late in the boil to get more aroma qualities from them.

Nitro dispensing is a newer method. In this case, N<sub>2</sub> is used under high pressure either instead of or with the CO<sub>2</sub>.

After that, there are lots of less-black-and-white brewing differences between styles of beer. For example, IPAs generally have a considerable amount of hops added, but that''s not always true. Hefeweizen has considerable amounts of yeast left after brewing, giving it its cloudy appearance. The list goes on and on.

Personally, I think that the traditional names for beer styles (stout, lager, IPA, wheat beer, etc.) are based a lot on brewing process, and in the case of something like lager or wheat beer, the name clearly shows the brewing origin.

In normal beer, the only sugar which enters the brewing process is from the malted barley: maltose and glucose released by the breakdown of starch, and a little sucrose and fructose. This [1953 analysis by a chemist in the Carlsberg research laboratory][1] has all the gory details.

Normal brewing yeast has enzymes that break down glucose and fructose, [but not lactose][2]. This kind of yeast evolved on rotting fruit, where there is plenty of sucrose, glucose, and fructose, but no lactose, so they never needed the enzymes. There are [other yeasts which can ferment lactose][3], but they aren''t used in brewing, except by zany vodka makers and Mongols.

So, in a normal beer, potentially all of the sugar can be broken down during brewing. Whether it is or not is up to the brewer, who can stop the process while sugar remains, or let it run to completion. However, in a milk stout, there is no way for the lactose to be broken down, so it all remains at the end.

The amount of lactose in a milk stout varies, but it seems that it is likely to be in the range of [5 to 13%][4]; that is, in a (568 millilitre) pint, there may be anywhere from 28 to 74 grams of lactose. The lactose concentration in milk is about [4%][5], so this is the equivalent of 700 - 1850 millilitres of milk. Rather a lot!

That said, how much of a difference it makes _to you_ is what''s important.  Going back to the wine comparison, I can sometimes tell the difference between different glasses, but not consistently.  So it''s not the _most_ important thing.

The "skunky" beer is actually lightstruck. This is exactly what it says: the beer has been damaged by light, such as sunlight or florescent light. When UV lights penetrate the glass of a beer bottle, they mess with the chemical makeup of some acids produced by the hops. The result is a new compound called methyl mercaptan, which is one of the components of the defense mechanisms found in the skunk.

This is prevented by packaging beer in brown bottles, which is better protected from UV rays. Unfortunately, this lets those green rays get in, which makes sense as to why some beers are served with lime: it keeps away the "skunky" smell for a while.

In reality, it doesn''t take much to spoil your beer. If your beer in a green or clear bottle has not already been spoiled before it got to the store, about a minute''s worth of exposure to the sun would do it.', 90);

As [explained by George de Piro][1], a biochemist and Brewmaster of C. H. Evans Brewing Company—

> When light hits beer, it provides the energy necessary to drive a reaction that transforms the iso-alpha-acids into 3-methyl-2-butene-1-thiol. The “thiol” part of that somewhat cumbersome name indicates that there is sulfur present. Sulfur compounds often have strong, offensive aromas. Some musteline animals, like skunks, have evolved the ability to produce this chemical, and use it for self-defense. [...] **This photochemical reaction is the only cause of skunked beer. Warm storage, while damaging to the flavor of beer, does not skunk it.** Cycling the temperature of beer from warm to cold and back again is also not implicated. Storing beer in the dark is the simple way to prevent skunking.

It''s actually pretty amazing how quickly this reaction can happen! From the same article,

> The photochemical reaction that skunks beer occurs very quickly; a well-hopped beer in clear glass can become noticeably offensive with just 30 seconds of exposure to sunshine. 

To wrap it up,

> Since light is an essential ingredient in the skunking process, beers packaged in kegs, cans, and opaque bottles cannot be skunked.

Here''s the most detailed experiment I could find—[The Impact of Lightstruck and Stale Character in Beers on their Perceived Quality: A Consumer Study][2].

Fractional freezing -- "jacking" in old parlance -- has a long history in the United States. The beverage applejack was produced using this method by first fermenting apple juice into hard apple cider. Then barrels of this cider were left outside during the winter and the connoisseur would occasionally fish out the frozen chunks of water, leaving an ever-concentrated batch of hard alcohol behind. At some point in the 20-25 percent ABV range, the liquor would stop freezing at ambient temperatures and the booze was ready to consume as "Jersey Lightning." It was also used as currency.

Moving into the malt-beverage world, brewers in Germany use fractional freezing to make eisbock. These brews are usually just regular bock beers, which clock in at 6 percent ABV, freeze-concentrated to something in the 13 percent ABV range. Frankly, there are probably easier ways to get high-proof beers (make a barleywine, for example) than by starting with a mid-strength one and concentrating it, but there''s a market for eisbocks and it''s possible to find them in the US as well. A more infamous set of freeze-concentrated beers was made by the Scottish brewery BrewDog in their quest to make "the strongest beer in the world." The first was Tactical Nuclear Penguin, a beer that started with an ABV in the teens and ended at 32 percent ABV. Then a little brewing war started up between BrewDog and German brewery Schorschbräu to make ever-stronger beers. Schorschbräu made a Schorschbock at 40 percent ABV, BrewDog countered with Sink the Bismarck at 41 percent ABV. Then came another beer at 55 percent ABV (that''s 110 proof, my friends). Schorschbräu is current record-holder with Schorschbock 57, at 57 percent ABV.

There are [literally dozens of different varieties of hops,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hop_varieties) in much the same way there are dozens of different breeds of dogs. Just as a Chihuaua and a Great Dane are both *Canis Lupus*, a Galena Hop and a Goldings Hop are bot *Humulus Lupulus*, separated by vastly different lineages and genetics. New hop varieties are often developed by selective crossbreeding of existing variants, to generate different flavor profiles by adjusting the acidity and oil content of the hop.

Like different breeds of dogs, different hop varieties are often the products of hundreds of years of genetic development in a particular climate -  the Pacific Northwest, especially the Yakima Valley and Cascade Mountains in Washington, Oregon and Idaho, is known for it''s production of very strong, highly acidic hops that impart a very strong bitter flavor - take a sip of a Sierra Nevada IPA and you''ll instantly recognize that classic blend of the ''three C''s''.

By contrast, traditional hops grown in England and on the European continent tend to be more mellow and aromatic - especially the so called ''noble hops'' popular in many less bitter tasting German and Czech beers. Still others, like Japans Sorachi Ace, offer a more citrus bite to the beer they''re added to. While these differences are not *directly* a product of climate, it''s doubtless true that climate has had an impact on the development of variation amongst the various hop lines that have been bred through the centuries -  and especially over the past 50 years or so.

Put another way: New World vs. Old World Hops is a meaningful distinction, but it has less to do with climate and more to do with the difference in cultivation practices and the specific varietals popular with farmers in various regions. Growing conditions may have some impact, but the specific lineage matters *much, much more*. The fact that those lineages tend to have significant geographic commonalities is as much an accident of history as it is of varying conditions, but it''s nonetheless sufficiently meaningful that, in particular referring to hops from the Pacific Northwest evokes a very specific and comprehensible flavor profile in most educated beer drinkers.', 8);

Obvious pairings to me would seem to include light, relatively bitter, hoppy beers.  Something like an IPA, an extra special bitter, or the like.

1.  Hops are mildly sedative.  It isn''t unreasonable to think that very hoppy beers may have a different effect than less hoppy beers.

2.  Gruit beers (unusual but there are some on the market!) often have other psychoactive ingredients in them too.  With historical brewing becoming a bit of an industry, it may only be a matter of time before we see commercially available henbane beer too....

3.  Alcohol absorption will be retarded by carbohydrate content in the beer.  You will absorb alcohol more slowly from a heavy beer than a light beer.

4.  Carbonation works the other way.  Lightly (or rarely available uncarbonated) beers will affect one more slowly than highly carbonated beers.  For most commercial beers this is not a significant factor but for home-brewed beers or specialty beers it may be.

With this being said, it isn''t clear that there is a single objective answer as to what beers will effect who in what way.  The purpose of this answer is to go over some factors which may impact how a given individual is affected.

Extrapolating from my experience here, I would expect a few general rules to apply:

1.  Beers with disparate sharp contrasts (particularly where fruit are involved) may benefit from aging.  I could imagine things like full-bodied apricot ales aging well.

2.  Higher ABV and richer beers are likely to age better than lower ABV and lighter beers.

 - Do not taste new beers with food or soon after eating. The lingering flavors from food can greatly affect your impression of the brew.
 - Cleanse your palate with water. Crackers or cheese are fine but you should remember that even these foods can affect the apparent flavors of the beer.
 - If you''re tasting a number of different beers, let the color be your guide. It is best to taste from light to dark.

Hops _may_ affect potency and sexual desire, in males at least, but there appears to be few clinical studies supporting this claim directly. Many articles online appear to have chained together several studies (or played news-telephone) to publish indirect conclusions, many of which oversimplify the effects of estrogen. For example, contrary to popular belief, it isn''t _testosterone_ (alone) which masculinizes the male brain and behavior, but rather _its interaction with estrogen_, produced _from_ testosterone through a process known as aromatization.<sup>1</sup> So it''s not as simple as more-estrogen-less-sex-drive.

<sup>[Milligan, S. R. et al. Identification of a potent phytoestrogen in hops (_Humulus lupulus_ L.) and beer. 1999. [PDF]][3]</sup>

However it''s worth noting that the same paper concludes,

> However, despite the high estrogenic activity of 8-prenylnarigenin, the total estrogenic activity of beer made using whole hops is still low [...] and no detrimental health effects due to "estrogens in beer" are to be expected.

Anyway, another study led by the same researcher delved into the mechanism of action:

(In case one is unfamiliar with how receptors work, receptors "catch" freestanding compounds in a medium such as the bloodstream, thereby reducing their effects. The phytoestrogen in hops appears to get itself "caught" by estrogen receptors, thereby blocking those receptors from catching estrogen it''d normally catch, thereby leaving higher levels of estrogen in the bloodstream.)

## ...but it''s not that simple!

Again, from these findings alone, conclusions about male potency and sex drive can''t be so easily drawn. Hormone interactions are sufficiently complex that researchers are still trying to untangle, isolate, and explain ever-more-specific biochemical pathways. Certainly the average Joe (or journalist) wouldn''t be _capable_ of appreciating the magnitude (or triviality) of the effects of biochemical pathways described in researchers'' findings, much less draw definitive conclusions about physiological effects like "potency," "sex drive," and how it all affects muscle-building. Not to mention all the other chemicals in play!

As a very example of the latter, one site [[link](http://www.peaktestosterone.com/Testosterone_Beer.aspx)] (which, unfortunately, ranks high among Google search results) is clearly biased, grasping for evidence to "prove" that beer has detrimental effects on testosterone activity. I''m not saying beer _doesn''t_, but their article states that Xanthohumol, another compound found in hops, "blocks testosterone," when in fact _the very paper it cites_ says, in its abstract nonetheless,

> Although hops is commonly linked with phytoestrogenic effects, we identified XN [Xanthohumol] as a pure estrogen antogonist. Interestingly, XN may also reduce the generation of estrogens by inhibition of the enzymatic activity of aromatase, which converts testosterone to estrogen.

The major change that gave origin to modern beers though is the **addition of hops**, for the first time creating a beer closely resembling modern lagers. The first documented use of hops in beer is dated 822 A.D.[ \[source\]][1] although records of hops cultivation dates back to 736 [\[source\]][2] which suggests use of hops in brewing predates written records by a considerable margin.

Beer has a very complex flavor and different recipes are different.  One can order beers (if specific enough to include a brand) along any dimension of flavor, but I am not sure that you can order them consistently along all dimensions.

Here are dimensions I would think of:

1.  Malty/caramel
2.  Hop-forward
3.  Bitter (Hops)
4.  Yeasty

Fermentation of grain is universal, as is fermentation of fruit and honey. You find it in the new world with drinks like chicha (an Andean drink where saliva provides the amylase to break down corn starch into sugars for fermentation), among Native Americans in North America as well, in early Europe, in early China, and early Japan as well.

Grain fermenting is a remarkably complex process because yeast can''t digest starch so you have to have some way of turning starches into sugars.  These break down into more or less three strategies:

1.  malting (roasting sprouted grains).  Interestingly doesn''t work for rice.
2.  helper cultures, like they use to make sake.  Add a fungus that breaks down starch and then a yeast to eat the sugar.  Indonesian "Tape" (rice or cassava "beer" or paste) is done this way as is Chinese rice beer and wine.  As a bonus this also works on other starches, like yams (used in Malaysia).
3.  Chewing the grains to mix with saliva and then spitting in a bowl as with the Andean Chicha drink.

South America has all three methods represented, as does early Asia.

The fact that different strategies are employed around the world suggests to my mind that brewing did not start somewhere and spread but was independently reinvented in different places.  It is probably for this reason extremely old, far older than we have direct evidence for.

As for beer, the question becomes what you mean.  If you mean fermented grains, we have no idea.  It''s very very old and might go back to neolithic times if not even earlier (though I suspect that the organized grain agriculture of neolithic times was an absolute prerequisite to grain fermentation).

If you mean malt, yeast, and hops, we still don''t know.  We have evidence that hops was cultivated for beer in Augustine''s time, and Old Norse distinguishes between beer and ale by the use of hops but Old English "beor" means something different (probably very strong mead with herbs?), suggesting perhaps that the hops distinction post-dated the split of Old Norse (and thus 8th century), but that doesn''t get you very far.

![enter image description here][1]

Orval has a very traditional and unique brewing process which involves
 the use of dry hopping, in which large meshed bags of hops infuse the beer during the three-week maturation period. The other is the use of Brettanomyces yeast during this same maturation, which are a local wild yeast. Hallertau, Styrian Goldings and French Strisselspalt hops are used. The beer is then matured at 15°C for a minimum of four weeks on site before being distributed.

If drunk right after bottling it has a "young" fresh flavor. The beer can be preserved for several years as it re-ferments once bottled. Even 35 year old Orval is still drinkable, if preserved at the right temperature. After about 1 year of preservation the beer flavor changes to a softer, sweeter and more intense experience compared to the young one.

There are two versions of Orval, one is the normal one which can be bought in the stores and then there is also a special *Petite Orval*, which can only be drunk at the Orval abbey and is only produced for the Monks (no mass sale). Its alcohol percentage is a lot lower than the normal Orval.

Fermentation of grain is universal, as is fermentation of fruit and honey. You find it in the new world with drinks like chicha (an Andean drink where saliva provides the amylase to break down corn starch into sugars for fermentation), among Native Americans in North America as well, in early Europe, in early China, and early Japan as well.

Grain fermenting is a remarkably complex process because yeast can''t digest starch so you have to have some way of turning starches into sugars.  These break down into more or less three strategies:

1.  malting (roasting sprouted grains).  Interestingly doesn''t work for rice.
2.  helper cultures, like they use to make sake.  Add a fungus that breaks down starch and then a yeast to eat the sugar.  Indonesian "Tape" (rice or cassava "beer" or paste) is done this way as is Chinese rice beer and wine.  As a bonus this also works on other starches, like yams (used in Malaysia).
3.  Chewing the grains to mix with saliva and then spitting in a bowl as with the Andean Chicha drink.

South America has all three methods represented, as does early Asia.

The fact that different strategies are employed around the world suggests to my mind that brewing did not start somewhere and spread but was independently reinvented in different places.  It is probably for this reason extremely old, far older than we have direct evidence for.

As for beer, the question becomes what you mean.  If you mean fermented grains, we have no idea.  It''s very very old and might go back to neolithic times if not even earlier (though I suspect that the organized grain agriculture of neolithic times was an absolute prerequisite to grain fermentation).

If you mean malt, yeast, and hops, we still don''t know.  We have evidence that hops was cultivated for beer in Augustine''s time, and Old Norse distinguishes between beer and ale by the use of hops but Old English "beor" means something different (probably very strong mead with herbs?), suggesting perhaps that the hops distinction post-dated the split of Old Norse (and thus 8th century), but that doesn''t get you very far.  What is pretty clear is that it certainly predates our earliest records of the practice.  By how much and when did it become a separate drink?  I don''t think we will ever know.  At any rate the early prevalence of hops as one herb used in brewing among many in early England and Scandinavia suggests (though does not prove) that hops were adopted (again as one herb among any) for beer brewing by the Germanic tribes, some time before we have written records.

Letting alone ethanol, which triggers innumerable biochemical pathways in our bodies, hops itself _may_ affect potency and sexual desire, in males at least, but there appears to be few clinical studies supporting this claim directly. Many articles online appear to have chained together several studies (or played news-telephone) to publish indirect conclusions, many of which oversimplify the effects of estrogen. For example, contrary to popular belief, it isn''t _testosterone_ (alone) which masculinizes the male brain and behavior, but rather _its interaction with estrogen_, produced _from_ testosterone through a process known as aromatization.<sup>1</sup> So it''s not as simple as more-estrogen-less-sex-drive.

I''m certainly not qualified to deliver conclusions myself, but I can at least point to some of the important studies from which current (mis)conceptions have derived.

<sup>1: [Wu, M. V. et al. Estrogen Masculinizes Neural Pathways and Sex-Specific Behaviors. 2009. [PDF]][1]</sup>

## Why some claim that hops decreases sex drive...

Hops contains phytoestrogens,

> substances that promote estrogenic actions in mammals and structurally are similar to mammalian estrogen 17&beta;-estradiol (E<sub>2</sub>) [...]

<sup>[Ososki, A. L. and Kennelly, E. J. Phytoestrogens: a Review of the Present State of Research. 2003. [PDF]][2]</sup>

Specifically,

> a recurring suggestion has been that hops have a powerful estrogenic activity and that beer may also be estrogenic. [...] We have identified a potent phytoestrogen in hops, 8-prenylnaringenin, which has an activity greater than other established plant estrogens.

<sup>[Milligan, S. R. et al. Identification of a potent phytoestrogen in hops (_Humulus lupulus_ L.) and beer. 1999. [PDF]][3]</sup>

However, it''s worth noting that the same paper concludes,

> [...] despite the high estrogenic activity of 8-prenylnarigenin, the total estrogenic activity of beer made using whole hops is still low [...] and no detrimental health effects due to "estrogens in beer" are to be expected.

Anyway, another study led by the same researcher delved into the mechanism of action:

> 8-Prenylnaringenin alone competed strongly with 17&beta;-estradiol for binding to both the &alpha;- and &beta;-estrogen receptors.

<sup>[Milligan, S. R. et al. The endocrine activities of 8-prenylnargingenin and related hop (_Humulus lupulus_ L.) flavonoids. 2000. [PDF]][4]</sup>

(In case one is unfamiliar with how receptors work, receptors "catch" freestanding compounds in a medium such as the bloodstream, thereby reducing their effects. The phytoestrogen in hops appears to get itself "caught" by estrogen receptors, thereby blocking those receptors from catching estrogen it''d normally catch, thereby leaving higher levels of estrogen in the bloodstream.)

## ...but it''s not that simple!

Again, from these findings alone, conclusions about male potency and sex drive can''t be so easily drawn. Hormone interactions are sufficiently complex that researchers are still trying to untangle, isolate, and explain ever-more-specific biochemical pathways. Certainly the average Joe (or journalist) wouldn''t be capable of appreciating the magnitude (or triviality) of the effects of biochemical pathways described in researchers'' findings, much less draw definitive conclusions about physiological effects like "potency," "sex drive," and how it all affects, say, muscle-building. Not to mention all the other chemicals in play!

As a very example of the latter, one site [[link](http://www.peaktestosterone.com/Testosterone_Beer.aspx)] (which, unfortunately, ranks high among Google search results) is clearly biased, grasping for evidence to "prove" that beer has detrimental effects on testosterone activity. I''m not saying beer _doesn''t_, but their article states that Xanthohumol, another compound found in hops, "blocks testosterone," when in fact _the very paper it cites_ says (in its abstract nonetheless),

> Although hops is commonly linked with phytoestrogenic effects, we identified XN [Xanthohumol] as a pure estrogen antogonist. Interestingly, XN may also reduce the generation of estrogens by inhibition of the enzymatic activity of aromatase, which converts testosterone to estrogen. Anti-estrogenic effects of XN [...] were confirmed in vivo in an uterotrophy assay with prepubertal rats.

<sup>[Strathmann, J. et al. Xanthohumol from Hops Prevents Hormone-Dependent Tumourigenesis In Vitro and In Vivo. 2008. [PDF]][5]</sup>

On top of all this, ethanol affects so many parts of the brain via so many chemical pathways—what''s even the significance of 8-prenylnarigenin or Xanthohumol when stacked against ethanol? Do you know?—I sure don''t—and probably no one does—else it''d have been stated by researchers themselves, without the "help" of attention-seeking bloggers and headline-hunting journalists.

## In conclusion,

I''m not saying these blogs, articles, and threads are necessarily _wrong_—they might be right, whether right-by-chance, or right-by-empiricism (observation). What I _am_ saying is that they can''t be _right-by-science_, as currently available research seems extremely domain-specific, incomplete in larger perspectives, and therefore not generalizable.

In my experience, the flip-top caps, the ones where you need a bottle opener (or wooden table, or set of house keys) to get open, tend to come on the more mid-range to expensive beers whereas the standard, mass-produced cheapies come with a screw-off cap. Although, this isn''t universal. I wonder if this is just a marketing technique (it needs a bottle opener so it *must* be good).

Several beers first get brewn on a barrel and then after a few weeks put onto a bottle after which sugar may be added. Adding the sugar causes a seconds fermentation which will result in a higher alcohol level.

You could also argue that the true source of many of these factors is variation in the brewing process, such as fermentation temperature, addition or subtraction of various steps, etc.  However if you come at it from the angle of "how do I categorize an unknown beer?", then the first four above are key.

Just like shaking a soda can, a lot of jarring will make the CO2 come out of solution. 

A trick I use on my homebrew system (I use 5 gallon kegs) is gently placing the keg on its side and slowly rolling it about 3 feet forward and then 3 feet back. Then, I place it back in the fridge and repeat 3 times throughout the day. This helps the CO2 re-dissolve into the beer. However, if you are pulling the keg out of a trunk, throwing it in a trash can and packing it with ice...this solution isn''t viable. In which case you want to let it settle and resist the urge to over pump.

Orval has a very traditional and unique brewing process which involves
 the use of dry hopping, in which large meshed bags of hops infuse the beer during the three-week maturation period. The other is the use of Brettanomyces yeast during this same maturation, which are a local wild yeast. Hallertau, Styrian Goldings and French Strisselspalt hops are used. The beer is then matured at 15°C for a minimum of four weeks on site before being distributed.

If drunk right after bottling it has a "young" fresh flavor. The beer can be preserved for several years as it re-ferments once bottled. Even 35 year old Orval is still drinkable, if preserved at the right temperature. After about 1 year of preservation the beer flavor changes to a softer, sweeter and more intense experience compared to the young one.

There are two versions of Orval, one is the normal one which can be bought in the stores and then there is also a special *Petite Orval*, which can only be drunk at the Orval abbey and is only produced for the Monks (no mass sale). Its alcohol percentage is a lot lower than the normal Orval.

<sup>[Smith, G. "Mulled beer." [URL]][2]</sup>


One mulls beer by simmering beer in a pan, nearly always with the following ingredients:

 - ginger
 - nutmeg
 - cinnamon
 - cloves
 - honey, agave nectar, or sugar

but also sometimes adding

 - egg yolk
 - cardamon
 - star anise
 - coriander
 - black pepper
 - allspice berries

and occasionally garnishing the drink with orange rinds. The mixture should be brought to a simmer but _not_ a boil, and heated for 5 to 10 minutes depending on the recipe.

Some even refer to _warmed_ beer as "mulled" beer, _i.e._ beer heated it _in its bottle_ in a pot (or slowcooker) filled with water. For this case, there is not a consensus on the heating temperature, as it appears to vary according to the beer:

> Mulled beer needs to be heated slowly. A slow-cooker half-filled with water works well. Just open the bottle and stand it in the uncovered appliance. I also have used a large pot on the stove, with the burner on low. Don''t let the water to get anywhere close to boiling -- 130 to 140 degrees is ideal. It''s also important to keep the water level constant, so replace the water as it evaporates.

<sup>[Brooks, J. R. "Brooks on Beer: Hot, Mulled Beer?" 2011. [URL]][3]</sup>

> Before serving, you warm the opened bottle [of Brasserie des Franches-Montagnes'' La Dragonne] in a pot of hot water to raise the ale''s temperature to about 110 degrees.

<sup>[Russell, D. "Cold day, cold beer? Give warm beer a try." 2010. [URL]][4]</sup>

> [Unibroue "Quelque Chose"] should be served like a mulled wine at 122 to 158 degrees Fahrenheit.

Secondly, I would wager that most breweries want the product to taste similar on draught as in a can or bottle, and it''s very uncommon to have nitrogen available in a taproom.  (You can get special taps which "cream" the beer on the way out, but again, for consistency those would have to be installed where-ever you sell your beer.)  So it''s something of an uphill battle.

Guinness, for example, has a specific serving temperature related to how it was traditionally stored in Ireland (Kegs in the "cold" room, which was often just a room carved out of the hill behind the pub or similar).

As far a why grocery and convenience stores keep it chilled, it''s basically appealing to the "grab and go" drinker, who intends on consuming it in the very near future, or with a short transport. Often they are slightly higher price than if you were to go to a liquor store.

Liquor stores have much larger selection and inventory, and refrigerating everything would be cost prohibitive. The price is generally slightly less than the grab and go locations, although many liqour stores still keep some of the more popular and mainstream beers in the cooler as well.

The one exception I can think of is bottle-conditioned beer.  Beer where some degree of fermentation occurs in the bottle, giving it both natural carbonation and causing the flavor to develop over time.

If the dominant flavor isn''t the fish but, say, curry or habenero, that''s a different matter.

Anecdote: In the context of a renaissance-themed event I once cooked from a 15th-century recipe for whitefish poached in ale.  I consulted my local brewing experts and together we made the ale ([recipe and documentation](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pwp/tofi/bmdl_brewers/ale_for_fish.html)).  They told me that the key difference in that time period was that ale didn''t use hops.  There were no leftovers.  Based on that experience, I usually reach for a low-hops medium-strength beer to go with whitefish.

 - Appearance (color, clarity, head, etc)
 - Flavor (sweetness, bitterness, dryness, alcohol, carbonation acidity, diacetyl, fruitiness, etc)
 - Mouthfeel (body, carbonation, smoothness, astringency, etc.)
 - Ingredients (yeast, mash bill, hops, added ingredients, etc.)

These guidelines are from the Beer Judge Certification Program, so they are by necessity based on idealized judging, rather than the intent to taxonomize all of known beer.

The first four are subjective, coming from the standpoint of categorizing based on the drinking experience.  The last, *Ingredients*, is objective and is used for quite a bit of general categorization (ale vs lager yeasts, for example).

You could also argue that the source of many of the subjective factors is variation in the brewing process, such as fermentation temperature, addition or subtraction of various steps, etc.  However if you come at it from the angle of "how do I categorize an unknown beer?", then the first four subjective items are key.  Some of the question is whether you focus on *what it is* or on *how it got that way*.

Then, I place it back in the fridge and repeat 3 times throughout the day. This helps the CO2 re-dissolve into the beer. However, if you are pulling the keg out of a trunk, throwing it in a trash can and packing it with ice...this solution isn''t viable.

Here is where the additional alcohol comes in:  To counteract the extra bitterness, the beers that have boiled longer have both additional malt added to balance the bitterness, and are given additional fermentation and conditioning time to allow the yeast to convert all of those malt sugars into alcohol.

## Beer is also alcohol

That is directly from [wikipedia][1]:

> Men''s sexual behaviors can be affected dramatically by alcohol. Both chronic and acute alcohol consumption have been shown in most (but not all) studies to inhibit testosterone production in the testes. This is believed to be caused by the metabolism of alcohol reducing the NAD+/NADH ratio both in the liver and the testes; since the synthesis of testosterone requires NAD+, this tends to reduce testosterone production.

> As testosterone is critical for libido and physical arousal, alcohol tends to have deleterious effects on male sexual performance. Studies have been conducted that indicate increasing levels of alcohol intoxication produce a significant degradation in male masturbatory effectiveness (MME). This degradation was measured by measuring blood alcohol concentration (BAC) and ejaculation latency. Alcohol intoxication can decrease sexual arousal, decrease pleasureability and intensity of orgasm, and increase difficulty in attaining orgasm.

Since wikipedia show related soruce of that info and most of them are clinical research, we can say that alcohol have a negative effect on men.

>In many women, alcohol increases sexual arousal and desire, although it does lower the physiological signs of arousal. Women have a different response to alcohol intoxication. Studies have shown that acute alcohol consumption tends to cause increased levels of testosterone and estradiol. Since testosterone controls in part the strength of libido in women, this tends to cause an increase in interest in sex. Also, because women have a higher percentage of body fat and less water in their bodies, alcohol can have a quicker, more severe impact. Women’s bodies take longer to process alcohol; more precisely, a woman''s body often takes one-third longer to eliminate the substance.

> Sexual behavior in women under the influence of alcohol is also different from men. Studies have shown that increased BAC is associated with longer orgasmic latencies and decreased intensity of orgasm. Some women report a greater sexual arousal with increased alcohol consumption as well as increased sensations of pleasure during orgasm. Because ejaculatory response is visual and can more easily be measured in males, orgasmic response must be measured more intimately. In studies of the female orgasm under the influence of alcohol, orgasmic latencies were measured using a vaginal photoplethysmograph, which essentially measures vaginal blood volume.

Different from men, we can say alcohol have more pros beside few cons for women.

## Beer and couples

### Men

Beer is probably the least powerful aphrodisiac alcoholic drink. The alcohol percentage in beer is low, meaning that more liquid has to be consumed to raise men''s testosterone levels to hit that "comfortable" level. Most beers are very nourishing and filling, and when too many of them are consumed, they can create an unpleasant stomachache. Drinking too much beer will make men go to the washroom more often, as well as create a bloating sensation. The effects of being bloated surely don''t entice sexual encounters and won''t lead men to seek out sexual opportunities. Yet, some special beers have a local reputation for increasing libido, but even with that, beer is not the best choice for men.

### Women

While hops in beer will have a negative impact on men’s hormonal balance, it may actually be positive for women. Hops has aphrodisiac-like qualities for women, as because of the phytoestrogen it contains, which mimic natural estrogen. Low sex drive in women is often cause by low levels of estrogen.

Consuming beer, especially hop-rich varieties like IPA, could actually help restore hormonal balance and help with libido and also alleviate menopausal symptoms of fatigue, irritability and hot flashes

Fermentation of grain is universal, as is fermentation of fruit and honey. You find it in the new world with drinks like chicha (an Andean drink where saliva provides the amylase to break down corn starch into sugars for fermentation), among Native Americans in North America as well, in early Europe, in early China, and early Japan as well.

Grain fermenting is a remarkably complex process because yeast can''t digest starch so you have to have some way of turning starches into sugars.  These break down into more or less three strategies:

1.  malting (roasting sprouted grains).  Interestingly doesn''t work for rice.
2.  helper cultures, like they use to make sake.  Add a fungus that breaks down starch and then a yeast to eat the sugar.  Indonesian "Tape" (rice or cassava "beer" or paste) is done this way as is Chinese rice beer and wine.  As a bonus this also works on other starches, like yams (used in Malaysia).
3.  Chewing the grains to mix with saliva and then spitting in a bowl as with the Andean Chicha drink.

South America has all three methods represented, as does early Asia.

The fact that different strategies are employed around the world suggests to my mind that brewing did not start somewhere and spread but was independently reinvented in different places.  It is probably for this reason extremely old, far older than we have direct evidence for.

As for beer, the question becomes what you mean.  If you mean fermented grains, we have no idea.  It''s very very old and might go back to neolithic times if not even earlier (though I suspect that the organized grain agriculture of neolithic times was an absolute prerequisite to grain fermentation).

If you mean malt, yeast, and hops, we still don''t know.  We have evidence that hops was cultivated for beer in Augustine''s time, and Old Norse distinguishes between beer and ale by the use of hops but Old English "beor" means something different (probably very strong mead with herbs?), suggesting perhaps that the hops distinction post-dated the split of Old Norse (and thus 8th century), but that doesn''t get you very far.  What is pretty clear is that it certainly predates our earliest records of the practice.  By how much and when did it become a separate drink?  I don''t think we will ever know.  At any rate the early prevalence of hops as one herb used in brewing among many in early England and Scandinavia suggests (though does not prove) that hops were adopted (again as one herb among any) for beer brewing by the Germanic tribes, some time before we have written records.

Now as for lager, these are far more recent.

Finally as a note, until maybe a hundred years ago, before modern capping and beer cans, most beer would have been sold uncarbonated, but speciality beers were carbonated much like champagne is today.  My own home brewing experiments (I even brew as a history nut) with non-carbonated beers suggest that they are of an altogether different character than carbonated ones (owing to the carbonic acid in carbonated drinks).  The flavors are lighter, sweeter, brighter, and more distinct, and entirely different than "flat" beer.  This is because dissolved carbon dioxide imparts extra acidity to beer.

**EDIT**:  It also occurs to me that controlled fermentation is one of the most common ways of preserving foods in the pre-industrial ages.  This includes lactic fermentation (that gives us shelf-stable cheese, salami, sauerkraut, etc), but also alcoholic fermentation must be included there too.  There''s no reason to think that the first fermented grains were fermented by accident.', 117);

When the can is opened, the pressure inside drops suddenly, causing the contents of the widget to be shot into the beer, agitating the beer, producing the foam. 

If this were tried with a regularly carbonated beer, you''d end up with foam erupting out of the can. Hence, beers packaged with a widget have only about 1/3 the carbon dioxide dissolved than regular beers, plus the nitrogen, which creates a smooth mouthfeel and dense foam. Due to the requirements of reduced carbon-dioxide, the widget is used almost exclusively with Stouts, Bitters and Irish Red ales - styles that can be served with lower volumes of carbon-dioxide.

Currently there are ten recognized trappists, of which eight are actively producing: 

Six Belgian trappists:

 - Chimay 
 - Orval
 - Westmalle
 - Westvleteren (St. Sixtus)
 - Achel (St.  Benedictus of the Achelse kluis)
 - Rochefort

Netherlands:

 - La Trappe (Brouwerij de Koningshoeven)

Austria: 

 - Stift Engelszell

There are also two aspiring Trappist breweries, one in the US named St. Joseph’s Abbey and another in the Netherlands called Abdij Maria Toevlucht. 

There are some strict rules to obtain "Authentic Trappiste Product":

 1. The beer must be brewed within the walls of a Trappist monastery,
    either by the monks themselves or under their supervision.
 2. The brewery must be of secondary importance within the monastery and
    it should witness to the business practices proper to a monastic way
    of life
 3. The brewery is not intended to be a profit-making venture.  The
    income covers the living expenses of the monks and the maintenance
    of the buildings and grounds.  Whatever remains is donated to
    charity for social work and to help persons in need.

There are some standardized naming conventions, for instance the Double (orginally used by Westmalle) is a brown ale which has an alcohol level of around 7%. 

The Tripple is another name first used by Westmalle, which are often blond and have an alcohol level of about 8% to 10%.

By reducing either or both of these, the beer will become lighter. As well as being lighter in calories, light beers are typically lighter in taste also.

Alcohol is reduced by starting with a lower amount of sugar in the wort (lower OG.) Residual sugars are reduced by reducing the amount of non-fermentable sugars. This can be done by adjusting the recipe to avoid malts that contain unfermentable sugars (such as Cara/Crystal malts, and highly kilned malts). Also the brewer can adjust the temperature that the grains are mashed to produce a more fermentable wort with less residual sugar.

To see how alcohol and carbs affect the calories in beer, here''s an excerpt from [this table][1] that lists the % abv, grams of carbohydrates in a 12.oz serving:

    Name        Brewer          abv     cal.    carbohydrates
    Busch Ice Anheuser Busch 5.9% 169 12.5g     
    Busch Light Anheuser Busch 4.1% 95 3.2g

The light beer has considerably less calories than the regular beer. In fact, around 80% of the calories in that beer come from the alcohol:

    1 g of alcohol = 7 kcal. 
    
    1 g of carbohydrate = 4 kcal.
     
    Volume of beer is 12oz. x 28.6g = 343ml.  Volume of alcohol is 4.1 % x
    343 = 14 ml
     
    To convert alcohol volume to weight, divide by 1.25. Weight of alcohol
    is 14 / 1.25 = 11.2g 

So

> Energy from alcohol is 11.2 x 7 = 78.4 kcal. As percent: 78.4/95 =
> **82%** 
>
> Energy from carbs is 3.2 x 4 = 12.8. As percent: 12.8/95 = **13%**

(The total is less than 100% - the data doesn''t account for protein, which is typically about 1g/12oz, which is about 4 kcal.)

By brewing the beer with an even lower %abv, the beer would be even lighter in calories, but possibly at the expense of flavor.

Serving beer at too high a pressure, or through a half-open faucet/tap agitates the beer, causing the foam you saw. 

The system is balanced by having the pressure inside the keg set to just a touch more (0.5-1psi) than the pressure resistance outside the keg. The pressure resistance outside the keg comes from the beer line and the tap - the longer the beer line, the more resistance. Also any increase in height between the keg and the end of the tap will increase resistance.

But even if the system was originally balanced, with the right dispensing pressure or adequate length of beer line, there are still some things working against you:

 - if the keg has been sloshed about, some of the carbon dioxide will have come out of the beer and into the headspace, creating more pressure. It takes several days for this to equalize again.

 - as the keg warms, the pressure inside the keg increases, since gas has a higher pressure at higher temperature with the same volume.

If you have a keg that is overpressured, you have 3 basic options:

 1. reduce the pressure inside the keg by venting some of the gas. Some kegs have a pressure relief valve that can be pulled to reduce pressure. But do it in small bursts, and try the beer after each until you see that the beer comes out not to quickly.
 2. increase the resistance outside the keg by using a longer beer line and/or placing the keg somewhere low and serving the beer higher. (e.g. keg at ground level and stand up to serve the beer.)
 3. dispense a large amount beer to a large jug - removing beer from the keg will reduce the pressure in the keg, and keeping it in a jug gives time for the head on the beer to settle down. While you''re waiting, just pour some more beer from the keg - this will come out slower and have less foam.

There are two important factors I see, looking at this as a history nut but not knowing of any sources on this topic.  The first, as you say, is widespread refrigeration.  But this was not the major factor in cold beverages generally since ice was often preserved into the summer for cooling beverages (and has been since ancient times).  But refrigeration makes this easier and thus cheaper.

The second is actually the modern bottlecap which is a product of industrialization.  Before the bottlecap most beers were served uncarbonated.  They might be chilled or not, but they would have been entirely uncarbonated, shipped in wooden barrels, etc. and had an altogether different flavor and character than our modern beers.  My experience playing with these concepts as a homebrewer suggests that such beers were better suited to being served warm than comparably dark carbonated beers.

To understand why, I think you have to look at carbonation and how temperature affects that.  Carbon dioxide is more soluble in cold water than warm water, so the warmer the beer is, the faster it goes flat, and the more it fizzes when opened.  So you have two ways carbonation affects the picture.  First it impacts the taste and serving conditions differently at different temperatures, and secondly it imparts a distinctive off-tang when the beer goes flat.  Temperature helps offset the latter to a mild extent but at the expense of the former.  I think this also helps explain why richer beers are more often served warm than lighter beers.', 117);

If you buy something like smoke-flavored beer, chili flavored beer, etc. these are probably made this way.

That''s where you take a fairly light beer on tap and add it to a glass along with a shot of flavoring syrup (like lychee or peach).

When boiling the wort, you can add hops to impart flavor midway through the process. If you add them at the beginning, you get bitterness primarily from the hops. If you add them at the end, you get primarily aroma from the hops.

The smoky bacon flavor comes both from the actual inclusion of bacon and from the smoked malt: *Briess Cherrywood Smoked Malt, Weyermann Beechwood Smoked Malt, House-smoked Hickory Malt*.  As discussed in http://beer.stackexchange.com/questions/53/does-chocolate-stout-contain-real-chocolate/65#65, certain flavors can be achieved through the malting process rather than through additional ingredients.  Similarly maple is fermentable and could be added directly to boost alcohol content and impart a more subtle maple flavor.

That said, this beer does contain actual bacon and "maple flavor".  To get a look at and when and how the flavors are added, we can look at [this clone recipe](http://www.brewtoad.com/recipes/inspired-by-rogue-voodoo-doughnut-maple-bacon-ale). 

    Name              Amount     Time        Use
    Fenugreek         0.25 oz    5.0 min     Boil
    Maple Extract     1.0 oz     6.0 days    Primary
    Bacon, cooked     4.0 oz     0.0 days    Bottle

Here, fenugreek is added during the boil phase, while creating the wort.  The boiling helps extract the flavor from the herb.  Maple extract gets added later during fermentation.  Maple extract or syrup could be used, but syrup is more expensive and fermentable so a stronger maple flavor is being achieved with extract.  The official ingredient list calls for "Pure Maple Flavoring" so I assume the same is being done there.  Lastly the bacon is being added at the end.  This is to add direct flavoring to the beer without interfering in the fermentation process.', 5);

Beer and ale, being grain-based, were important dietary staples -- it''s said that beer is liquid bread, and that''s not far off.  For the common man (not nobility), in particular, grain made up a substantial part of the diet, with meat being fairly rare.  (Will try to update later with a friend''s research on amount of grain/household consumed in medieval England, but it''s substantial.)

Common beer was not aged for months or years like some beers today; rather, a batch might be produced in as little as half a week.  These are "small beers" (or "small ales", for the unhopped variety), which are mildly alcoholic but drinkable in volume without unfortunate effects.  These small beers/ales were produced in the home/manor; it was just one more task for the cooks.  (See, for example, Markham''s *The English Housewife*, 1615 -- so that''s rnnaissance not medieval, but is consistent with earlier cooking sources I''ve seen.)

I''m not aware of exceptions being made for pregnant women and small children.  Arguing from absence of evidence is risky, but I''ve worked with a variety of medieval and renaissance cookbooks and the occasional medicinal source, and I haven''t seen anything along the lines of "drinks for the pregnant and young".

With that said, in addition to kidney benefits:

 - Beer contains high amounts of silicon, which makes bones stronger
 - In moderation, it has been shown to lower the risk of cardiovascular problems. However, when abused, cardiovascular problems spike instead. It helps to raise levels of "good cholesterol" which helps to keep arteries free of blockages.
 - It may help out your brain, keeping Alzheimer''s disease at bay.
 - It is high in antioxidants and helps reduce your risk of cancer.
 - It is high in B vitamins, namely B6 and B12
 - Moderate amounts of any alcohol, beer included, may help decrease your risk of stroke by reducing the chance of blood clotting in the cardiovascular system.
 - I highly doubt this one, but apparently, studies have shown a reduced risk of diabetes among men who drink occasionally.
 - Studies have shown that it has been linked to lower blood pressure.
 - It contain fiber! Beta-glucans in particular, which are a soluble type of fiber.
 - Like sauerkraut, pickles, kimchi, yogurt, miso, and kombucha, beer is a fermented food, so many of the benefits of fermented foods such as aiding in digestion may apply to beer as well.

1.  I have heard of people washing their hair with it, believing it helps promote healthy hair and scalp.

2.  Heavy, high starch beers, have long been used as a food source for fasting monks, sort of a liquid bread.

3.  Beer is commonly used for cooking certain things because the alcohol (as with wine) helps bring out certain flavors.

Additionally I want to mention something I use it for.  This works for me because of very specific reasons and **I am not recommending that anyone else try it.**  However, I get asthma frequently following upper respiratory illnesses (I have since I was a teenager).  I have a couple of alternative medical strategies for dealing with this depending on what is available.  Note, if you have asthma, don''t take medical advice from me: asthma can be life threatening.  Work with a doctor.   However, among other things, I find that drinking a number of drinks of beer or wine for two nights in a row will cause the asthma to clear up until I get sick again.  This naturally works best when I am not otherwise consuming alcohol, but it allows me to be mostly medication free regarding my asthma (doing this two to three times a year).  Again this has a bunch of risks, so I am mentioning it just for informational purposes.  In general anything medical deserves a great deal of respect because what can cure can kill.

Also some kinds of traditional beer have very specific health benefits.  In Indonesia, "tape hitam" (black rice beer, consumed with the lees as a sort of soup) is generally understood to reduce blood cholesterol.  As it turns out the helper cultures used are extremely close (and sometimes the same) as those which produce lovostatin.

- Unless it''s an unfiltered wheat beer, in which case the yeast is meant to go in the glass.  Also, hefeweizens like this should go for a little larger head than normal (2-2.5 fingers).
- Or if it''s a nitrogenated beer (Eg, Guinness with a widget), you should simply [upend the can or bottle into the glass](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNCaV3e9BEg&feature=youtu.be)

  However, those are mostly the result of differences in the impurities in the alcohol (that is, all the non-alcohol stuff that differentiates beer from wine from vodka).  And for those differences, it''s largely the difference between different types of liquor.

Beer is, compositionally, pretty much the same.  There might be enough difference between a heavy chocolate stout and a hoppy IPA, but between different brands of lighter beers (like pilsners), there''s unlikely to be a noticeable difference in hangovers barring a weird food allergy to a minor element of one pilsner vs another.

Some far more likely causes of your friends reporting worse hangovers for different brands of the same beer type are:

- Different quantities between evenings.  One evening you drank 10 Pilsner Urquells and the next you drink 8 Beck''s.  How well are you really counting at that point?  If you think you had "about 9 beers" both nights, you might blame the worse hangover on Pilner Urquell.
- Differences in alcohol level between brands.  The difference between 3.8% and 4.2% adds up after a while.
- Small sample size.  Would you rely on a medical study of only 3 or 4 people?  Probably not.  Likewise, if your friend reports getting a bad hangover the last 3 or 4 times they drank Konig, it may just be a bit of coincidence, and they would have had a nasty hangover those nights regardless of what they drank.', 80);

I read somewhere about making ice cubes *from beer* somewhere, so that they don''t dilute your beer (you need a good freezer for that though). I can''t vouch if they don''t affect the taste though.

--------

Beer glassware serves a few primary purposes:

 - it is part of the branding of the beer (for beers with their own glass)
 - it presents the beer (beauty is in the eye of the beer holder) showcasing the beer''s color, clarity and/or carbonation.
 - it influences how quickly volatiles (aromatics) are released
 - it influences how much beer can be consumed per sip (e.g. compare champagne flute vs. beer mug)
 - it can promote head retention (through the shape, plus small etchings in the base of the glass)

Some examples
-------------

 - A Pilsner glass is a long tall V-shaped glass. It emphasizes the
   color, clarity and effervescence of the Pilsner. It''s similar in
   principle to the fluted champagne glass, but having larger rim,
   affords larger sips.
   
 - The traditional mug is a robust glass, primarly aimed at "chinking"
   glasses together and allowing large swallows of beer. 
   
 - The challace/goblet can be beautiful pieces of work, designed to
   showcase the beer, and also promote and maintain a large head. 
   
 - The tulip glass captures volatiles (in the narrow part of the glass)
   while the large opening at the top supports a large head.
   
 - The Sniffer, typically used for cognac/brandy, but also for very
   strong ales, has a large base that curves up to a small opening to
   capture the aromatics, and to allow for swirling to encourage more
   aromatics to be released.
   
 - The Stange, a long tall glass, amplifies the malt and hop
   characteristics by concentrating them in a smaller area, while also
   providing a simple elegant presentation of the beer. Often used with
   delicate beers.
   
 - The Weizen glass is similar to the pilsner glass, but larger
   (typically 0.5l minimum) with plenty of room for the large head
   typical of a wheat beer.

I doubt this is the case—if an ingredient were impractical to obtain in other seasons but one, then I''d imagine the price of that seasonal beer would be extraordinary, which isn''t the case with Sam Adams'' seasonal beers.

If by chance there _do_ exist such ingredients, then the next question is—are any of those ingredients used in Sam Adams'' seasonal beers, which itself is a difficult question, since Sam Adams'' recipes are proprietary. From Sam Adams'' site, though,

> Samuel Adams® Octoberfest is a malt lover''s dream, masterfully blending together five roasts of barley to create a delicious harmony of sweet flavors including caramel and toffee. The beer is kept from being overly sweet by the elegant bitterness imparted by the German Noble hops.

Unless one of those "five roasts of barley" (providing the above is even true and not a marketing statement itself) is some rarity in other seasons, which I highly doubt, again, I''d say mass produced seasonal beers are only "seasonal" for the sake of marketing and inducing a certain feel—

With that said, most of the recipes I''m seeing make it clear that you want to use a light beer, so obviously you''re not gonna want to use a stout or porter here (though I''d be curious how it tastes; my friend swears by Guinness in his beef stew). With that said, most lagers or pilsners (a type of lager) should be fine for your purposes (of course I would avoid macro-lagers like Bud, Coors, and Miller because they are awful). [Anchor Steam Beer][1] might be interesting in the soup as it packs a lot of flavor for a lager type beer in my opinion. For authenticity, you''re likely gonna want to use a [pilsner][2]. You have to realize, as the Wikipedia article points out, that until the 1840''s or so, most beer from the area was top-fermented (like ales; modern pilsners and lagers are bottom-fermented) and the taste varied widely, so I''m not sure how a beer 300-500 years ago would have tasted. The closest you''ll likely be able to go back is the 1840''s; in which case I''d give Pilsner Urquell a shot as it''s the first pilsner beer in the world. Victory makes a mean pilsner ([Braumeister Pils][3]) too. Unfortunately it''s draft only, so if you have a growler handy you can use it; otherwise best look elsewhere. Of course you can probably get away with most [Czech pilsners][4]. I can''t figure out why Beer Advocate doesn''t have a sorting option so that you can sort based upon the rating, but I digress. 

You have to remember that beer was much different 300-500 years ago. Yes, there are some breweries such as  Dogfish Head who recreate ancient ales. Yards has also recreated three brews based upon George Washington''s, Thomas Jefferson''s, and Ben Franklin''s (my favorite of the three) original recipes. But for the most part, beer has evolved in the last 300-500 years; even in the case of the Dogfish Head and Yards brews I mentioned since they have to be pasteurized and must meet the (stupid) FDA standards here in the US. If you''ve ever tried raw milk, you know how much pasteurization changes the flavor; same goes for juice and beer.

With that said, lets go back to the whole top-fermenting thing. You might want to give a [grätzer][5] a try as well. It''s an ancient Polish beer which has been recently making a comeback. There''s a [project][6] going on right now to recreate the brew. However, since the brew is so (recently) new, I''m not sure how available it is; you''ll likely have to make a trip to San Francisco to get some. There are others too, such as those offered by [Westbrook Brewing Co.][7] and [Schlossbrauerei Au][8]. But I''m not sure how readily available these are either. You''re probably better off brewing this once yourself until this beer is pulled off the "endangered beers" list.

Traditionally (say, 1000 years ago), yes, brewing recipes would vary with the seasons.  Some ingredients like henbane seed or barley keep extremely well.  Others do better  fresh (herbs and such).  It is likely that gruit components varied with the seasons.  This is not an issue today.  Aside from some components of other beers (pumpkin ale, beers with seasonal fruit), most beers today do not involve ingredients that are problematic to preserve over a year.

There is a second issue though.  That is that beers traditionally have another factor which is starch content.  The starch contributes significantly to calorie count of the beer, and usually darker, richer beers have higher carbohydrate count.  It makes sense to consume more calories in cold weather than warm weather, and it makes sense that darker, heavier beers would be favored in winter while lighter beers would be favored in summer (although as one would note the heavier beers came out of traditions of using them as bread substitutes for fasting monks and so would have year-round applicability in monasteries).

I don''t think it has to do with availability.  I think instead it has to do with seasonal expectations and reserving richer, heavier, higher starch beers for the winter.  I don''t know when this became common though.  In general, when I look back a thousand years ago, I don''t see anything in primary sources to suggest heavier malts in the winter.  So trying to date this would seem speculative.  There is a fairly obvious practical pattern though.

These are important questions.  Lumping around a thousand years and very different cultural eras (ranging from the Vendell-era Norse to the Byzantine Empire) into the same label is problematic at the very least.

The answer I think to the question as stated has to be "no" insofar as there were times and places in the Middle Ages where beer was a clear luxury (early medieval Iceland comes to mind).  Similarly, it isn''t always clear that beer was universally consumed by the lower classes in much of the Middle Ages (though certainly towards the end it became more common).

This being said, beer was an important dietary staple in much (though not all!) of medieval Europe at least among monks, merchants, and the upper classes.  Heavier beers were used as bread substitutes.  For the common man in Anglo-Saxon England, though, even bread was a luxury  and most grains were cooked into gruel, porridge, either with or without fracturing (think of bulgur wheat).  This would then be supplemented with vegetables, eggs, dairy, and sometimes meat (even for the serfs, at least in Anglo-Saxon England, meat was not out of the question).  Well water was the primary source of hydration in this era (again see Hagen, below), and laws were passed to ensure that drinking water directly from someone else''s well was protected, legal activity (in other words, a well owner could restrict what people could take away from the well, but not what they could drink on the spot).

If we separate out the lower classes and the areas where beer was not commonly available (Iceland, for example) the picture changes dramatically.  Beer was very common, but not at all a homogeneous beverage.  Bald''s Leechbook (10th Century, Anglo-Saxon) contains the warning that while "ealu" (-> ale) may be consumed by pregnant women, "beor" (-> beer) causes miscarriage.  Identifying these beverages is problematic. Ann Hagen ("Anglo-Saxon Food and Drink") suggests that "beor" must have been a strong mead instead of a malt liquor based on descriptions of specific gravity (she calculates a minimum alcohol content of around 20%).  If it was a strong mead, it may have been further supplemented by herbs like mugwort, henbane, and hops, and therefore even more problematic than a strong mead might be.  In this case, it would have been fermented grains would have been certainly consumed by children and pregnant women.

Interestingly the traditional fermented rice and cassava dishes here in Indonesia are acceptable to serve to children too.

These aspects of the beer are evaluated to see if they match with what is expected for the style:

 - appearance: color / foam / clarity
 - aroma: malt / hop / yeast / esters
 - mouthfeel: body / carbonation
 - flavor: lots here - see below
 - aftertaste: flavors and aromas that persist after the beer is swallowed
 - overall impression: drinkability 

All of these are evaluated with respect to what is expected for the style, and points assigned. The beer may be perfectly drinkable, but be marked down because it doesn''t fit with the style. For example, a hefeweizen that is dark would be lose points for appearance since they are light-colored beers by style.

Judging sheets often have a list of flavor descriptors. Some flavors are bad for any beer, such as rubber, astringent, soapy, while others may or may not be considered faults depending upon style. For example, fruitiness in an English Ale is much desired, but not in a Pilsner, similarly low levels of diacetyl in a Stout is acceptable, but not in a Hefeweizen.

I didn''t know much about beers until I moved to San Diego last year, where I was introduced to [beer flights](https://www.google.com/search?q=image+beer+flight&espv=210&es_sm=93&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X). Somehow, I''d never heard of or seen them!

A flight is 4 or 5 small servings of beer, typically in 4.5- to 5-oz. glasses, usually served on a "paddle," as you can see in the images. At least in San Diego, a flight costs as much as a pint on draught, so often it''s a no-brainer to get flights if you want to taste a variety of beers. When you order a flight, you of course get to choose what 4 or 5 beers you''d like to have. I often select similar beers—a set of stouts and porters—or a bunch of IPAs (and doubles)—so I can really get a chance to taste what distinguishes specific brands and subtypes.

When a friend of mine flew in from New York (also never having heard of flights), he was enthusiastic about getting two flights and sharing all 10—doing blind tests on one another. He went from saying, before we got to the bar, "All beer tastes the same to me—I can only taste dark or light," to, "Oh man, I didn''t know I was even capable of tasting such tiny differences!"

So, I think beer flights are an effective yet casual and fun way to get someone to appreciate the multifarious tastes of beers.

These are important questions.  Lumping around a thousand years and very different cultural eras (ranging from the Vendell-era Norse to the Byzantine Empire) into the same label is problematic at the very least.

The answer I think to the question as stated has to be "no" insofar as there were times and places in the Middle Ages where beer was a clear luxury (early medieval Iceland comes to mind).  Similarly, it isn''t always clear that beer was universally consumed by the lower classes in much of the Middle Ages (though certainly towards the end it became more common).

Example 1:  Anglo-Saxon England

This being said, beer was an important dietary staple in much (though not all!) of medieval Europe at least among monks, merchants, and the upper classes.  Heavier beers were used as bread substitutes.  For the common man in Anglo-Saxon England, though, even bread was a luxury  and most grains were cooked into gruel, porridge, either with or without fracturing (think of bulgur wheat).  This would then be supplemented with vegetables, eggs, dairy, and sometimes meat (even for the serfs, at least in Anglo-Saxon England, meat was not out of the question).  Well water was the primary source of hydration in this era (again see Hagen, below), and laws were passed to ensure that drinking water directly from someone else''s well was protected, legal activity (in other words, a well owner could restrict what people could take away from the well, but not what they could drink on the spot).

If we separate out the lower classes and the areas where beer was not commonly available (Iceland, for example) the picture changes dramatically.  Beer was very common, but not at all a homogeneous beverage.  Bald''s Leechbook (10th Century, Anglo-Saxon) contains the warning that while "ealu" (-> ale) may be consumed by pregnant women, "beor" (-> beer) causes miscarriage.  Identifying these beverages is problematic. Ann Hagen ("Anglo-Saxon Food and Drink") suggests that "beor" must have been a strong mead instead of a malt liquor based on descriptions of specific gravity (she calculates a minimum alcohol content of around 20%).  If it was a strong mead, it may have been further supplemented by herbs like mugwort, henbane, and hops, and therefore even more problematic than a strong mead might be.  In this case, it would have been fermented grains would have been certainly consumed by children and pregnant women.

Interestingly the traditional fermented rice and cassava dishes here in Indonesia are acceptable to serve to children too.

Sources on history:

1.  Hagen, Ann.  "Anglo-Saxon Food and Drink"
2.  Pollington, Stephen.  "Leechcraft" (for an edition of Bald''s Leechbook with facing page translation).

Example 2:  Medieval Iceland

The early Icelandic settlers tried to grow barley for beer with only very limited success.  Alcoholic beverages were thus very much a luxury item, and usually if someone was going to have it (going mostly by medieval saga evidence as ethnography), it was going to be someone who had gone viking and returned with a fair bit of wealth.  A second point though is that Icelandic society recognized about three levels of society (godhi, bondi, and thrall) based on relationship to certain kinds of property:  a godhi (priest-attorney-legislator-jurist) owned a godhord (the office was property and could be sold, loaned, or even put into partnership property).  A bondi (free juryman) owned land.  And a thrall was owned (though the actual requirements would have been more like early serfdom than slavery due to a lack of central administration and enforcement).  In addition to successful bondi-turned-vikings, you would have had the fact that a godhi had sufficient economic benefits from office to likely be able to afford alcoholic beverages at least sometimes.

In Iceland, drinking was usually a social action and as far as the existing evidence goes would have been a specifically male activity limited to the sorts of ritualized drinking portrayed in Beowulf (such ritualized drinking is portrayed in the Volsung Saga, Egill''s Saga, Njall''s Saga, and many many others).  Drunkenness was warned against in the literature, and there are very interesting questions of what else was put in the beverages, since poisoning was a pretty clear concern in the literature (Eddic poems such as Havamal and Sigdrifumal speak to both these concerns).  From archaeological evidence from "continental" Scandinavia, we may surmise henbane was common, and this may to some extent play into the references to military drinking in Hrolf Kraki''s Saga.

In short, in Iceland, as far as we can tell, beer and mead would have been limited to far more ritualized roles (reinforcing social obligations, certain forms of oaths, etc).  Literature on women and alcohol is very sparse.  It''s probable that the bride drank at the wedding as part of making the wedding official.  There''s a lot of uncertainty beyond this however in terms of attitudes towards pregnancy and alcohol.

This is easily converted to calories per 100 ml beer by accounting for the final gravity (FG, in (g beer)/(ml beer)). In turn, 100 ml is converted to 12 oz by a scalar (3.55, in (100ml/12 oz))

The acid is useful in adjusting the pH of the [mash][1] during brewing. Typically brewers use a 1-10% with 2-5% being typical. 

The malt''s existence is due to the [Reinheitsgebot][2] - the German Beer Purity law. This forbids the use of any ingredients other than malt, hops, water and yeast - making the use of other additives to adjust mash pH illegal. Hence, saurmalt was developed as a way to allow brewers to adjust the mash pH while staying within the restrictions of the purity law.

Nowadays, using a [sour mash][3] goes way further than just correcting pH. It''s used to define the sourness in some beers, such as Berliner Weisse, Lambics, Flemish Reds and Browns and Stouts. 

So, while you can''t buy a beer made only with sour malt, there are plenty that have used it, or an equivalent souring technique to produce the sour notes in the beer.

By contrasting beers side-by-side, we build an _internal_, as-of-yet-wordless "vocabulary" of tastes, _e.g_ "This beer has more of... _that thing_, whatever it''s called, than this one," and _then_ we learn terminology (and ingredients and processes) as a means of filling those voids in words for senses we''ve experienced.

It''s easy to "just drink it".  If you want to really pay attention to the beer, there''s nothing better than forcing yourself to write it down.  The format doesn''t matter much, but I prefer a multi-part tasting form to force me to think about each part of the beer.  For example, I usually break it down into 4 sections:

- Appearance: How much head?  How long did the head last?  What color was it?  What color is the beer itself?
- Aroma: What do you smell?  How strong is the smell?

As wikipedia states:

In modern times, the category has been interpreted to mean:

 - a light to golden ale
 - use the Dupont yeast, which gives particular esters and pepper characteristics (hence they have a "Belgian" character)
 - around 7% abv
 - fruity, spicy (some examples add fruit, such as apple juice.)
 - highly carbonated

This might seem quite vague, but the combination of yeast, light malt, strength and carbonation lead to a fairly unique and identifiable beer.

Tannins, the chemicals that are transferred from the oak barrels to the wine, are extremely good at forming hydrogen bonds (just look at the structure!), which makes them very soluble in water. Considering that both beer and wine have no shortage of water in them, these molecules are quite willing to join either substance.

As for the aeration, I believe that may actually be an undesirable consequence of using the barrels for beer. However I can''t imagine the effects being very profound unless you were aging the beer like you would with wine (months or years versus weeks).

What you want is a good *experience*, and taste is only a part (albeit a major part) of that.

Having different glasses for different types of beers can affect your drinking experience in a number of different ways. First off, having an unusual or unique glass can often be very fun, because it''s probably not something you''re used to. The first time I ever drank beer from a litre mug was a very fun experience for me, and not because it made the beer taste differently. Secondly, I find that different types of glasses encourage me to enjoy beer in different ways. I find that glasses with stems, which are often used for stronger beers, encourage me to drink the beer more slowly and savour it a bit more than a glass without a stem. I think these effects on experience are one of the big reasons for the wide variations in beer glassware. As a beer manufacturer, if I could make a unique glass that will better help people remember my beer, I would consider that a worthwhile investment.

I''m not trying to say that the effects of glassware on taste don''t exist or are unimportant; I think they are important. But they''re only part of the story.', 68);

 - **Always rinse your glasses immediately**: your job''s much harder if the lacing and sediment dries caked on the glass.

 - **Use a beer-specific cleaning agent**, a percarbonate cleaner like PBW, One-Step or B-Brite.  These are formulated specifically to deal with the compounds that beer leaves in a glass.

If you only ever drink beer out of your beer glasses and always rinse them soon after, you''ll find that you can wash with a pretty weak cleaning solution.  I almost never need more than about 1/2 ounce of PBW in a gallon of hot water.

The beer has already been fermented when added to a conditioning tank, where it is left to mature for several days (the 7th step), from here it is cooked to remove the alcohol. Due to the absurdly high boiling point of water (100°C), it is easy to evaporate the alcohol (boiling point = 78.3°C) and leave the rest of the beer behind.  Vacuum evaporation is also used in most modern breweries to preserve flavor and speed up the process.

Another method used is reverse osmosis, which allows the water and alcohol to escape from the beer through a membrane. The alcohol is then distilled from the solution, and the water is added back to the sugary syrup originally left behind, reforming the beer (minus alcohol).

A major factor in that is acidity, and both hops and carbonation contribute.

Acidic solutions react with metals to produce hydrogen gas and dissolved metal salts.  So carbonic acid from carbonated beer will react with the tin to produce hydrogen and tin carbonate, and the same basic process with other metals.  The specific metal that reacts will depend on the pewter.

There are some ways around this.  You could, for example, coat the inside of the vessel with bees wax.

With only 25% of the carbon dioxide, there is less concern of creating too large a foam. Plus the nitrogen causes the foam to be made of very very small bubbles, which readily turn back into beer. You can see this as the cascade [(video)][1] after the beer has been poured hard into the glass.

If the beer served on nitro has more than 35% CO<sub>2</sub> then it''s a good idea to reduce how hard you pour - as the percentage of CO<sub>2</sub> increases, so does the size of the foam with a hard pour.

Letting alone ethanol, which triggers innumerable biochemical pathways in our bodies, hops itself _may_ affect potency and sexual desire, in males at least, but there appears to be few clinical studies supporting this claim directly. Many articles online appear to have chained together several studies (or played news-telephone) to publish indirect conclusions, many of which oversimplify the effects of estrogen. For example, contrary to popular belief, it isn''t _testosterone_ (alone) which masculinizes the male brain and behavior, but rather _its interaction with estrogen_, produced _from_ testosterone through a process known as aromatization.<sup>1</sup> So it''s not as simple as more-estrogen-less-sex-drive.

I''m certainly not qualified to deliver conclusions myself, but I can at least point to some of the important studies from which current (mis)conceptions have derived.

<sup>1: [Wu, M. V. et al. Estrogen Masculinizes Neural Pathways and Sex-Specific Behaviors. 2009. [PDF]][1]</sup>

## Why some claim that hops decreases sex drive...

Hops contains phytoestrogens,

> substances that promote estrogenic actions in mammals and structurally are similar to mammalian estrogen 17&beta;-estradiol (E<sub>2</sub>) [...]

<sup>[Ososki, A. L. and Kennelly, E. J. Phytoestrogens: a Review of the Present State of Research. 2003. [PDF]][2]</sup>

Specifically,

> a recurring suggestion has been that hops have a powerful estrogenic activity and that beer may also be estrogenic. [...] We have identified a potent phytoestrogen in hops, 8-prenylnaringenin, which has an activity greater than other established plant estrogens.

<sup>[Milligan, S. R. et al. Identification of a potent phytoestrogen in hops (_Humulus lupulus_ L.) and beer. 1999. [PDF]][3]</sup>

However, it''s worth noting that the same paper concludes,

> [...] despite the high estrogenic activity of 8-prenylnarigenin, the total estrogenic activity of beer made using whole hops is still low [...] and no detrimental health effects due to "estrogens in beer" are to be expected.

Anyway, another study led by the same researcher delved into the mechanism of action:

> 8-Prenylnaringenin alone competed strongly with 17&beta;-estradiol for binding to both the &alpha;- and &beta;-estrogen receptors.

<sup>[Milligan, S. R. et al. The endocrine activities of 8-prenylnargingenin and related hop (_Humulus lupulus_ L.) flavonoids. 2000. [PDF]][4]</sup>

(In case one is unfamiliar with how receptors work, receptors "catch" freestanding compounds in a medium such as the bloodstream, thereby reducing their effects. The phytoestrogen in hops appears to get itself "caught" by estrogen receptors, thereby blocking those receptors from catching estrogen it''d normally catch, thereby leaving higher levels of estrogen in the bloodstream.)

## ...but it''s not that simple!

Again, from these findings alone, conclusions about male potency and sex drive can''t be so easily drawn. Hormone interactions are sufficiently complex that researchers are still trying to untangle, isolate, and explain ever-more-specific biochemical pathways. Certainly the average Joe (or journalist) wouldn''t be capable of appreciating the magnitude (or triviality) of the effects of biochemical pathways described in researchers'' findings, much less draw definitive conclusions about physiological effects like "potency," "sex drive," and how it all affects, say, muscle-building. Not to mention all the other chemicals in play!

As a very example of the latter, one site [[link](http://www.peaktestosterone.com/Testosterone_Beer.aspx)] (which, unfortunately, ranks high among Google search results) is clearly biased, grasping for evidence to "prove" that beer has detrimental effects on testosterone activity. I''m not saying beer _doesn''t_, but their article states that Xanthohumol, another compound found in hops, "blocks testosterone," when in fact _the very paper it cites_ says (in its abstract nonetheless),

> Although hops is commonly linked with phytoestrogenic effects, we identified XN [Xanthohumol] as a pure estrogen antogonist. Interestingly, XN may also reduce the generation of estrogens by inhibition of the enzymatic activity of aromatase, which converts testosterone to estrogen. Anti-estrogenic effects of XN [...] were confirmed in vivo in an uterotrophy assay with prepubertal rats.

<sup>[Strathmann, J. et al. Xanthohumol from Hops Prevents Hormone-Dependent Tumourigenesis In Vitro and In Vivo. 2008. [PDF]][5]</sup>

On top of all this, ethanol affects so many parts of the brain via so many chemical pathways—what''s even the significance of 8-prenylnarigenin or Xanthohumol when stacked against ethanol? Do you know?—I sure don''t—and probably no one does—else it''d have been stated by researchers themselves, without the "help" of attention-seeking bloggers and headline-hunting journalists.

## In conclusion,

I''m not saying these blogs, articles, and threads are necessarily _wrong_—they might be right, whether right-by-chance, or right-by-empiricism (observation). What I _am_ saying is that they can''t be _right-by-science_, as currently available research seems extremely domain-specific, incomplete in larger perspectives, and therefore not generalizable.

## Addendum

The study by Ososki and Kennelly also states

> As potential endocrine disrupters, phytoestrogens may act as antiestrogens and harm the reproductive health of males (Sharpe and Skakkebaek, 1993; Santti _et al._, 1998). Reduced sperm quality, undescended testes and urogenital tract abnormalities were increased in the sons of mothers taking DES compared with those who did not take the miscarriage preventative drug [...]

This statement is initially misleading as it says "males" instead of "_developing_ males"—a fact not made clear until the following sentence. From the studies it cites (emphasis mine),

> We argue that the increasing incidence of reproductive abnormalities in the human male may be related to increased oestrogen exposure **in utero**, and identify mechanisms by which this exposure could occur.

<sup>[Sharpe, R. M. and Skakkebaek, N. E. Are oestrogens involved in falling sperm counts and disorders of the male reproductive tract? 1993. \[URL\]][6]</sup>

> Exposure to diethylstilbestrol (DES) induces persistent structural and functional alterations in the **developing** reproductive tract of males.

<sup>[Santti R. et al. Phytoestrogens: Potential Endocrine Disruptors in Males. \[URL\]][7]</sup>

So, more potential sources of misunderstanding and misreporting.

But in reality most pub Stouts such as Guinness are quite light beers, in terms of they''re physical density (specific gravity.)

Some reasons that Stouts can taste and feel heavier:

 - Stouts tends to be more bitter, so tougher to drink for those not used to it
 - Serving on N<sub>2</sub> ("Nitro") creates the illusion of a thicker mouthfeel (it''s not fully understood at present quite why that is)
 - The lower CO<sub>2</sub> levels removes a certain "light" quality from the beer. Beers with more CO<sub>2</sub> feel lighter, effervescent and easier to drink.

 1. Since the keg is kept at room temperature, if the beer is unpasteurized the flavor will evolve at a faster rate than refrigerated beer would.  This isn''t a change due to the quick cooling, per se, but it is a possibly major difference.
 2. As mentioned by @acheong, the CO2 solubility of beer is significantly lower at room temperature, so keeping the beer properly carbonated becomes a more difficult task.  Specifically, you have to keep the pressure much higher, making the serving pressure higher, which makes the complex calculus of draft line measurements that much harder.
 3. Chill haze could be an issue.  If the brewer didn''t take steps to prevent it, there''ll be haze-inducing proteins in suspension.  If the beer is stored cool, these will quickly fall out, but if it''s kept warm and only cooled at the time it''s served, they''ll end up in your glass.', 224);

Sure there is always a risk that a different culture of fungi or bacteria takes over, killing off the yeast (and e.g. producing vinegar instead of alcohol) but if brewing is performed in relative cleanliness, with little contaminants that could disrupt the process, the natural yeast will take over and dominate it, killing off all competing cultures.

There are a few factors that determine how long a beer takes to be ready to drink.  The original gravity of the beer (gravity measure the amount of sugar in the wort), the type and strain of yeast used, and alcohol content of the finished beer.  Other factors such as any adjuncts used in the beer can affect this as well.

For example, a low gravity, low alcohol ale using an efficient yeast strain can be ready to drink in as little as 10 days.  However a heavy lager beer can take 2-3 months to complete and some Belgian yeast strains can take several weeks to complete fermentation.

Some beers go through additional conditioning post-fermentation before they are at their prime to drink.  This conditioning may include simple bottle conditioning or barrel-aging to impart different flavors.  There are some barrel-ages stout beers that have taken 18+ months to complete the process before the brewer feels they are ready to serve.', 263);

The second picture shows S. cerevisiae (common ale yeast) and a wild yeast S. eubayanus making some new cold tolerant yeast strain babies that are the common lager yeast (S. pastorianus).

Though yeast was only identified as a microorganism recently, it has been known as the cause of fermentation for many centuries.  It''s easy to underestimate how sophisticated people throughout history were.

Before yeast was monocultured in labs it was actively cultured by brewers.  They would transfer the yeast cake from a batch that''s finishing into a recently-brewed batch.  This cake contained a whole ecosystem of yeasts and bacterias, but a few strains were usually dominant.

By applying artificial selection brewers developed different strains of yeast in different areas.  The yeast culture was *the* make-or-break characteristic of a brewery, and defined the styles of beer that could be produced more than any other factor (other than water in Burton).

Evidence of this process comes from the history of lager: bottom-fermenting yeast (Saccharomyces carlsbergensis) emerged in the fifteenth century as a direct result of the cold storage regime of northern brewers such as Carlsberg.

Other bacteria could cause the fermentation to vinegar.

In the case of your British bitters, age-old recipes were probably designed to allow the beer to taste its best at room temperature.

That said, my general thought is that you should drink a beer at the temperature you most like it, so the _should_ part of your question is self-determined, and don''t let anyone tell you that your taste buds are wrong.

Myself, I tend to like my American IPAs cooler than the typical recommended serving temperature.  And before I visited the UK, I couldn''t stand a room temperature beer.

Formaldehyde was detected in beer, at safe levels, as far back as 1983:

> A simple procedure was developed for the determination of formaldehyde in samples of beer and soft drinks. [...] Levels of formaldehyde found were in the low mg/kg range. Detection limits were less than 0.1 mg/kg of sample.

<sup>[Lawrence, J. F. and Iyengar, J. R. The Determination of Formaldehyde in Beer and Soft Drinks by HPLC of the 2,4-Dinitrophenylhydrazone Derivative. 1983; published online 2006. \[URL\]][1]</sup>

A more recent study summarizes how China came under scrutiny, but also how industry standards have changed since (emphasis mine, hereon):

> In 2005, various Chinese newspapers reported that formaldehyde was detected in 95% of the samples of Chinese commercial bottled beers tested in the course of a journalistic investigation. The addition of formaldehyde during mashing is allowed in China, and it is believed to improve the clarity of the resulting wort and beer and the colloidal stability of the latter. **Nevertheless, the hygienic standard for fermented alcoholic beverages in China was revised, to stipulate that the formaldehyde content of the finished beer must not exceed 2 mg/L.**

<sup>[Wu, Q. _et al._ Investigation into Benzene, Trihalomethanes, and Formaldehyde in Chinese Lager Beers. 2012. \[PDF\]][2]</sup>

From the abstract of the same paper,

> Beers brewed commercially in China have been surveyed for the presence of a number of potential contaminants, including benzene, trihalomethanes and formaldehyde. [...] Formaldehyde was measured in 29 beers (including 7 imported brands) using solid-phase microextraction with on-fiber derivatization. Formaldehyde levels were between 0.082&ndash;0.356 mg/L. **None of the beer samples exceeded WHO drinking water criteria for benzene, trihalomethanes or formaldehyde.**

The researchers compared their results to existing literature, which they found were similar:

> Donhauser and co-workers examined beers from Europe, using a HPLC method, and showed that 65% of them contained detectable formaldehyde, although in many the level was close to the detection limit of 0.2 mg/L. More recently, the South Korean Food and Drug Administration has analysed imported beers (13 from China and 4 from Germany). They found that the average content of formaldehyde was 0.132 mg/L, which was compatible with food safety legislation.

(I couldn''t find a free link to the above-referenced material, only [a citation](http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?f=1987/DE/DE87098.xml;DE86J0377).)

Apparently, formaldehyde does appear naturally in the brewing process (though, again, I couldn''t find the study, only [another citation](http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?f=2012/OV/OV201203266003266.xml;DE19950083764)):

> Borchert has confirmed that formaldehyde can be formed naturally in the brewing process, thus beers can contain up to 0.1 mg/L of formaldehyde, even when none is used in the brewery.

Anyway, formaldehyde no longer seems preferred as a clarification agent, as a substitute exists:

> To meet consumer expectations and to avoid further problems, more and more breweries now choose [PVPP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyvinylpolypyrrolidone) as a replacement product for the clarification of wort and beer.

In the case of a US brewery making such a claim, it''s a sort of advertisement toward the "purity" of their product, i.e., they don''t use adjuncts (rice, etc) or other flavorings (fruit, spices) in their beer.

One could argue the tradition has kept German brewers from innovating, and also keeps a lot of interesting styles out of reach.

*Warning*: This method is error-prone, high-effort, and probably not worth your time.  Could be fun, though.  :)

Most commercial beer is *force-carbonated*.  That is to say, the beer is produced and ready to drink (minus the fizz) before they put it in the bottle and mechanically carbonate the beer.

Beer that is *bottle-conditioned* or *bottle-fermented*, however, is put into a bottle with some extra sugar.  The beer is intentionally left with a little of the yeast from the fermentation process, and is sealed with the sugar.  The yeast then does it''s normal thing: it eats the sugar and excretes alcohol plus carbon-dioxide.  Since the bottle is sealed, the CO2 has nowhere to go, so it goes into dissolution in the beer, giving you that fizz.  Most bottled homebrew will be like this.

So, if you have a beer that is both flat and was bottle-conditioned (and therefore still has some yeast in it), you might be able to bottle-ferment it again:

1. Add a very small amount of sugar to the bottle.  Table sugar works, although corn sugar (which you can find from a brew store) is ideal.  It''ll be really hard to get the right amount (about 0.083 oz), so I recommend pre-measured tablets of the stuff: http://www.northernbrewer.com/shop/munton-s-carb-tabs.html
2. Seal the bottle somehow.  If you have a [bottle-capper](http://www.amazon.com/Bottle-Capper-Red-Baron-Homebrew/dp/B000Q6ARMY) and some caps, that''d be ideal.  Otherwise, you might be able to get by with a soda bottle and cap.  If you''re really lucky, your beer is in a [swing top](http://www.homebrewers.com/media/img/homebrewer/W1033-H1573-Bffffff/B/xbottle_swingtop_amber_16oz_.jpg) bottle.
3. Wait a week, maybe a couple to be sure.

If you''re lucky, there''s enough viable yeast in the bottle to start acting again (now that it has new sugar to eat), which will create more CO2 and recarbonate the bottle.', 80);

Other factors such as any adjuncts used in the beer can affect this as well.

For example, a low gravity, low alcohol ale using an efficient yeast strain can be ready to drink in as little as 10 days.  However a heavy lager beer can take 2-3 months to complete and some Belgian yeast strains can take several weeks to complete fermentation.

Some beers go through additional conditioning post-fermentation before they are at their prime to drink.

According to it, the suggested pairing for an IPA is

> Strong, spicy food (classic with curry!); bold, sweet desserts like carrot cake

and for a Double/Imperial IPA is

> Smoked beef brisket, grilled lamb; Southern chicken-fried steak.

I found a great little [summary by Michael Agnew (2012)](http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2012/03/what-to-eat-with-ipa-india-pale-ale-food-pairings.html) that explains some of the rationale behind these pairings (emphasis mine hereon):

> When pairing IPA with food you have three basic flavor hooks at your disposal; bitterness, hop flavor (spicy, grassy, herbal, earthy, and citrus), and caramel. Hop flavors have a great affinity for spices and light fruits. Bitterness has a cooling affect. Paired with **spicy dishes**, IPA will fan the flames at first, but douse them in the end. Bitterness also amplifies **salty and umami flavors**. The caramel flavors in the beer will latch onto the sweeter side of a dish, tying into things like **caramelized onion** or the crispy skins of roast poultry. And the hop acids and carbonation make IPAs **great palate cleansers** to take on even the fattiest deep-fried delights.

We seem to have found strong consensus already, but just one more to make sure. In [Blue Point Brewing Company''s words](http://bluepointbrewing.com/bpbc/food-pairings/guide-to-pairing/), its IPA pairings are meant to complement

> intensely flavorful, highly spiced dishes, such as curry, and bold, sweet desserts like flourless chocolate cake and crème brulée

> rich, aromatic, spicy and smoked foods such as chili, BBQ ribs, grilled chicken, and beef.

It is believed that these farmhouse beers would have been of a lower abv than modern saisons - probably initially around 3 to 3.5% abv on average, rising in the early 20th century to between 4.5 and 6.5% abv. Modern saisons are brewed in a range of countries, particularly the USA, and are often bottle conditioned.

Here''s another for 2011 showing porters as quite low on the list.

This chart shows the year-over-year increase in sales by style.  You''ll note here that, at least in 2011, porters weren''t growing very fast either.

More recent data was a little hard to come by, but it seems that the overall sales numbers are unlikely to change *that* much in a couple years: IPAs, Pale ales, Ambers and Amber Lagers are probably still topping the charts.  So it''s not that porters don''t sell at all, but they''re certainly not top earners.

Drifting into conjecture, I would say that the people interested in ''big beers'' will take a stout over a porter, and those interested in a more subtle beer will go for a brown or an amber, leaving porters in a bit of a no-man''s-land in the middle.

The layman''s summary from [Scientists discover why beer bottles overflow after a sudden impact][1]:

> A lot happens in the short period of time between tap and torrent. The
> moment some jerk clocks your bottle''s mouth, a compression wave
> travels down through the glass. When the wave hits bottom, it''s
> reflected as an expansion wave that travels through the beer. These
> waves keep bouncing back and forth, with the compression waves
> breaking up the CO2 bubbles in your beer into thousands of incredibly
> tiny microbubbles, and the expansion waves causing those microbubbles
> to violently expand into skyrocketing plumes.
> 
> The result? Millions and millions of expanding CO2 bubbles turn your
> beer into foam shooting out of your bottle. With any luck, it spills
> all over your jerk friend''s pants.

The abstract from the [published article][2]:

> A sudden vertical impact on the mouth of a beer bottle generates a
> compression wave that propagates through the glass towards the bottom.
> When this wave reaches the base of the bottle, it is transmitted to
> the liquid as an expansion wave that travels to free surface, where it
> bounces back as a compression wave. This train of
> expansion-compression waves drives the forced cavitation of existing
> air pockets, leading to their violent collapse. A cloud of very small
> daughter bubbles are generated upon these collapses, that expand much
> faster than their mothers due to their smaller size. These rapidly
> growing bubble clusters effectively act as buoyancy sources, what
> leads to the formation of bubble-laden plumes whose void fraction
> increases quickly by several orders of magnitude, eventually turning
> most of the liquid into foam.

The "Pale" in Pale Ale is mostly historical. In the 18th century, most beers were dark due to being produced with barley malt that was kilned or roasted over wood fires. But from England emerged a new technique using [pale malts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mash_ingredients#Pale_malt), cured in [coke-fuelled kilns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coke_(fuel)). This applied to both ales and lagers, resulting in beers that were bronze, copper or gold—and while you wouldn''t look at such colors today and consider them notably "pale," they certainly were pale in contrast to beers back then. In the turn of the 19th century and beyond, the style spread from England to the rest of Europe—

> When a new brewery was built in Pilsen in Bohemia in 1842, a coke-fired kiln was imported from England. The result was the first golden lager, Pilsner Urquell, which was made possible by British ingenuity and technical advance.

 2. [By distillation][4]: the sample is heated, so the water and ethanol (alcohol) evaporate off and are collected in a condenser. The specific gravity of this is measured, which can then be used to calculate the percentage of alcohol, since the densities of alcohol and water are both known. 

Both methods are exact and the accuracy is entirely due to the accuracy of the equipment used to measure. 

The least accurate and precise is the case of (say) a microbrewer using a regular glass hydrometer to measure the OG and FG (method 1 above) - these read to 4 significant digits, with an accuracy of +/-1 SG at best. Without getting into the details, the accuracy then is about +/-5% of the final value for a regular strength beer. So for a 5% beer, that would be +/-0.25%.

With lab grade equipment, the accuracy of method 2 can be as good as 0.05%, since the specific gravities are measured with greater precision (and accuracy.)

 1. [By wort gravity][1]: by measuring the [specific gravity][2] of the [wort][3] (the sugar solution that the yeast ferment into beer) both before and after fermentation. The difference is the amount of sugar consumed, which can be used to approximate the amount of alcohol produced. 
 2. [By distillation][4]: the sample is heated, so the water and ethanol (alcohol) evaporate off and are collected in a condenser. The specific gravity of this is measured, which can then be used to calculate the percentage of alcohol, since the densities of alcohol and water are both known. 

Both methods are exact and the accuracy is entirely due to the accuracy of the equipment used to measure. 

The least accurate and precise is the case of (say) a microbrewer using a regular glass hydrometer to measure the OG and FG (method 1 above) - these read to 4 significant digits, with an accuracy of +/-1 SG at best. Without getting into the details, the accuracy then is about +/-5% of the final value for a regular strength beer. So for a 5% beer, that would be +/-0.25%.

With lab grade equipment, the accuracy of method 2 can be as good as 0.05%, since the specific gravities are measured with greater precision (and accuracy.) So our 5% beer would be with accuracy 0.0025%.

Winemakers were allowed to continue producing various grape products like grape juice, and even sold home wine kits with explicit instructions on how to avoid making wine from them.  Very tongue-in-cheek.  A lot of liquor distillers managed to survive somewhat on their liquors being considered "medicinal".  Beer, however, basically got demolished.  Especially considering their suffering during World War 1, which had just ended when prohibition began.  Any businesses that survived prohibition that used to be breweries either became producers of other products like ice cream or made barely alcoholic barley-based beverages.  Brewing in the US was at a huge disadvantage coming out of prohibition, and the few surviving large companies managed to successfully lobby to have the new distribution laws written to benefit them.

Also, as I mentioned wine and liquor sort of continued to be produced during Prohibition.  This led to their presence in the speakeasies, and their inclusion in the invention of many new cocktails.  People being used to them over the past few years, and the allure of being what was drank in speakeasies, acted as built in marketing.  Which beer lacked.

Finally, beer was much less transportable than wine or liquor, especially liquor.  While localized wineries managed to survive, most people''s local brewery had folded.  Liquor and wine became go-to drinks, and the only beer being promoted was from a few larger companies that needed to ramp up to reach everyone.  They were basically able to write their own ticket.

We''re sort of in the opposite place now where consumer demand is for beer instead of liquor and wine, and the demand is for beer that''s coming from smaller and more regional breweries, which I imagine is how wine was back in the day.

# Part of it is political

The companies that make beer are not generally the same ones that make liquor.  Those two groups of companies also have different groups of lobbyists, who have pushed for laws at different times in different political climates.

# Part of it is practical

Liquor and beer production face different logistical needs.  For example:

- Beer has much higher shipping costs per dollar worth of product, so shipping rules might need to be different.
- Breweries have a need to keep their product cold at the point of sale, so it might make sense to have them sold in stores that already have coolers (like gas stations), whereas liquor companies wouldn''t push as hard for that availability.
- Liquor has no equivalent of the brewpub, so they don''t really care much about sales at their production facility.
- Beer has less consumer utility per unit of volume than liquor (ie, you need more of it to have the same amount of fun), so people generally need it closer to their houses.  Since you don''t need to buy liquor as often as you buy beer, it''s more feasible to have centralized liquor stores

<sup>[Roberts, K. E. Mechanism of Dehydration Following Alcohol Ingestion. 1963. \[Abstract (HTML)\]][1]</sup>

As far back as the 1930s, researchers were trying to understand whether alcohol—the substance itself—is a diuretic, or indirectly induces chemicals which are diuretic (or which inhibit antidiuretics) or triggers cortical functions that cause diuresis.

> [Most] writers either state categorically or imply that alcohol per se has no diuretic action. In 1932, however, from a comparison of the diuretic effects of a given volume of water, with and without alcohol, [...] Murray concluded that alcohol itself was exerting a diuretic action. [...] The diuretic action of alcohol has now been demonstrated on five other subjects, and its mode of action investigated [...]

<sup>[Eggleton, M. G. The Diuretic Action of Alcohol in Man. 1941. \[Full Paper (PDF)\]][2]</sup>

The first paper (1963) actually confirmed that **alcohol—yes, ethanol itself—inhibits antidiuretic hormones, causing diuresis, causing dehydration.** (Caffeine does this too, by the way.)

So, yeah. That''s how that happens.

---

Unrelated, but I found this interesting in the second paper...

> It [the diuresis] is initiated by the _increase_ in blood-alcohol concentration and fails to be maintained if this concentration is kept steady, even at high levels [...] The diuretic response to alcohol differs markedly in one respect from that of the cerebral cortex. The latter is most affected by the _rate_ of increase in blood-alcohol concentration: the greater this rate of increase, the greater the disturbance of function at any absolute concentration. The diuretic response, on the other hand, is dependent mainly on the _duration_ of increasing blood-alcohol concentration and not on the rate of increase (Tables 6, 7). The naturally slow absorber, therefore, tends to give a larger diuretic response than the rapid absorber.

The slower you get drunk, the more dehydrated you''ll be!

Barley Wines - Oxidation
------------------------
Barley wines are not hop flavor or aroma focused beers - the major hop component is bittering acids, so they don''t suffer the same problem with aroma losses as IPAs. However, some of the bittering compounds also have a [half-life of 1 year][2], so clear changes are happening in that timeframe to the bitterness.

However, the major change for a barleywine is oxidation. There is always oxygen in the beer - either small amounts introduced during packaging, or from oxidization during the mash, which is then later released into the beer. When compounds in the the light to medium colored malts in the beer oxidize, they produce sherry or port-like tones to the beer, which in a big barleywine are considered positive effects of aging, if kept in check. 

Stouts
------
Contrasting with both IPAs and barleywines, Stouts that are meant for aging are neither hop focused nor benefit much from oxidation. Oxidizing the medium roasted malts in the wort would produce cardboard flavors due to production of [trans-2-nonenal][3]. Fortunately, the highly kilned malts act as an anti-oxidant to help prevent the beer from oxidizing. What little odization does occur tends to produce port-like flavors.

The roasty character in stout comes from large Maillard compounds. These are still poorly understood, I can''t find research to back it up, but I would guess the roasty character mellows due to the large compounds breaking down into shorter ones. This might explain why in some stouts the dark fruit flavors become more emphasized over time (since they are shorter Maillard compounds.)

Let''s look at two different distinctions you make.

**Home Production**

In the US, you can usually make your own beer, mead, or wine, but cannot make hard liquor without a license from BATF, state licenses, tax payments, etc.  Exact laws of course vary state by state, but the US tax code contains exemptions for home brewers and wine makers.

Part of the reason here is historical.  Liquor is a major tax source, and black market liquor hasn''t always been very safe.  We hear stories about wood alcohol making people go blind, but the real problems were either accidental heavy metal poisoning or deliberate adulteration with relatively nasty chemicals.  In practice methyl alcohol was not a major problem, particularly accidental inclusion of it, as in most concentrations primarily makes the hangover significantly worse (btw, red wine is known for harsh hangovers as are some fruit brandies because of methyl alcohol content).  The adulterants have included (and do include in some parts of the world) things like battery acid, caustic soda, and the like.

A second problem of course is safety.  In the distilling process, you are dealing the combination, usually, of heating elements or open flames and a liquid that is roughly as flammable as gasolene.  While it is quite possible to distil safely, there are generally acknowledged gains health and safety-wise to pushing for a formal economy here.

**Wine Tastings vs Beer Tastings**

Here laws vary considerably between states.  For example, the one part of the liquor code that is explicitly applied to home brewers is an exemption for home brewing competitions.  So you can take your beer to a competition without losing the home brewing exemption.

Wine tastings have almost always had some acceptance on the theory that making fine wine has a level of cultural refinement and aesthetic nuance that beer does not (we may find this false but it an attitude --- if you don''t believe me, compare reading a wine review with a beer review).  The wine culture is different from the beer culture and so they make a different case.

Again laws here vary state by state.  However, the argument, I think, is that wine tasting is essential to the sales process, while beer drinkers are less picky on average.

In essence these laws have a practical component particularly where hard liquor is concerned, and a cultural component.', 117);

## OG is “Original Gravity”

Specific Gravity (often shorted to just ‘gravity’) is a measure of the density of a liquid.  Since its is mostly water, you can compare beer’s density to water to find out how much other stuff is in it.  Water has a gravity of 1.000, and beers will often have an original gravity of 1.200 to 1.020.

“Original Gravity” is the density of beer before it’s fermented (when it’s called ‘wort’), and “Final Gravity” is the density after it’s fermented.  You can determine the alcohol content of a beer by comparing the two gravities and inferring how much fermentable “stuff” disappeared during fermentation (i.e., was converted to alcohol and CO2).

In commercial beer, you can use OG as a shorthand for how “Big” the beer is because it indicates how much malt and other fermentable stuff was in it.  So a lighter-flavored beer like a blonde or a pilnser will often have a low original gravity (1.020 to 1.050, for example), whereas a big stout or barelywine might have a higher original gravity (1.080 up to as much as 1.200).

OG is in important measurement for home brewers, so another use of it on a commercial beer is to help people produce clones of said beer at home by reproducing the OG (among other factors).

**Side note**
To get a little more technical, Specific Gravity is the ratio of the density of one liquid to another.  In brewing, we always use water.  So, the density of water divided by the density of water is 1.000.  The density of beer divided by the density of water is what we refer to as ‘gravity’ when discussing beer.  And since it’s a ratio of two identical measures, there are no units.  It’s not 1.000 somethings; it’s just 1.000.', 80);

### Plato

Homebrewers often use "brewer''s points" (eg 1.123), but you''ll sometimes see the "Plato Scale", which is more popular in central Europe.  A good approximation is that 1˚ plato = 4 brewer''s points.  So 12˚ Plato corresponds to a gravity of 1.048.', 80);

- what is best for the beer
- what is best for the tasting scenario

For the beer, a serving size that is appropriate should:

- provide sufficient beer to not warm up excessively in the cup or glass in the minute or two tasting is underway. This means serving sizes should be at least 60ml/2 oz. (If the beer is served too cold, leave it in the bottle to warm, so that all samples are poured together and tasted at the same temperature.)

For the tasting situation we have to consider:

- There may be a limited amount of an evaluation beer to share between the number of judges so serving sizes should be restrained. 

- Furthermore, some additional beer should be left over in case a re-evaluation is necessary. This is particularly important with styles where volatiles are a key contributor, since they dissipate quickly, plus the olfactory sense quickly becomes tired, requiring a pause and then a fresh sample.

Taking these two into account gives a typical serving size in the order of 3-4oz/75-100ml.

Note that the glass can be larger - particularly a long tall glass is good for capturing the aromatics of a smaller sample.

The reason has nothing to do with alcohol content or getting drunk (some beers like Belgian tripels, imperial stouts, or barley wines can easily clock in at a higher ABV than wines). It''s got more to do with the human tongue itself and how taste buds are organized on the tongue. Essentially, beer is a much more complex drink; beer tasters use all of their taste buds while wine drinkers may only use a select few. So when you drink beer, you''re not going to be overwhelming any set of taste buds unevenly while you run that risk when drinking wine.  Generally when drinking wine, you''re only using your sweet and sour sets of taste buds. For instance, I don''t know about you, but I''ve never really had a bitter wine. I''ve had sweet or sour wines, but never bitter or salty wines. On the other hand, I''ve had all of that with beer. 

If you look at the diagram of the tongue below, you''ll notice that the bitter taste bud receptors are on the back of the tongue. In order to reach these receptors and taste the beer to its fullest, you must swallow the beer.

In *theory*, larger bottles mean that the little bit of air trapped at the top of the bottle is smaller compared to the volume of beer than it would be in a standard 12 oz bottle.  However, I''ve been unable to find any research backing this up, and anecdotally it makes no difference.

Larger bottles are favored for aging beers mostly for practical reasons:

- Stores are more willing to sell a single large bottle (whereas many often require the purchase of an entire six-pack for smaller beers)
- It''s easier to share a large bottle, which you often want to do with a good beer you''re aging
- They''re often (but not always) cheaper than the equivalent beer split up between several smaller bottles.

From what I can tell, it’s a special occasion beer for the crowd that isn’t into good beer.  They drink cheap lager year round, but if they want to reward themselves, celebrate an occasion, or make a party a bit more interesting, they’ll break out a strong lager.

The aftertaste of beer is more important than it is in wine, and much of the aftertaste comes from swallowing.

Also, beer isn''t generally as alcoholic as wine, so the risk of getting drunk on a taste is lower.  Although some beers can be in the 10-12% range, the average abv is much lower.

Further, although the idea of a [tongue map](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongue_map) has been relatively discredited in scientific circles, it was taught in schools for a long time.

After around 50 or 60 glasses, there was no statistical evidence whatsoever that any of the three could be identified, or tasted better.

From my personal experience though, I always think that a keg  is better than a bottle is better than a can. But why is that so? I only have the theory that due to the feeling of the container you drink from, your taste is altered (just like food with the same flavour/taste somehow tastes differently, with a different texture). Additionally I think the amount of beer that flows into your mouth is differently, as well as maybe the turbulence, causing a different amount of carbon dioxide (or nitrogen, depending on your beer culture) to leave the beer before you can actually taste and swallow (which again changes the texture)

- the color - darker beers age better than lighter ones

 1. *Strong Beers:* like such as barleywines, robust porters, and imperial stouts. It is benefical if a beer is 8-10 percent or stronger, since an elevated alcohol profile will typically become smoother, mellower and more agreeable. That does not mean lower alcohol percentage beers can not be aged, but higer percentage beers are more suitable most of the time. 
 2. *Dark Malt:* like Palo Santo and World Wide Stout. Darker, maltier beer is better because the sweet, residual sugars tend to soften over time. Even lower-alcohol beers with a malt-heavy profile will age better. 
 3. *Wild Beers:* living organisms change the beer as it ages in the bottle. Orval Trappist Ale is a classic example. The Belgian pale ale receives a dose of Brettanomyces yeast as it goes in the bottle. The yeast can live in the bottle for years, slowly consuming sugars and protecting the beer’s existing flavors by consuming oxygen. Over time it goes from being bright and hoppy to bready, earthy and spicy. But sometimes they are unstable, because the yeast rapidly works through a beer and alters its character.

*What not to age:* IPA do not improve with age. Hoppy beers are not for aging.', 81);

I think that the real difference is going to be between keg beer and can/bottle beer.

Canned/bottled beer has a longer shelf life than keg beer. Canned/bottled beer has a shelf life of roughly 45-60 days, whereas a keg is only 25-40 days.

This means that worst case scenario for comparison you could be tasting a 2 month old canned beer versus a 3 week old draft. It can cause a difference in taste, there is a "freshness date" after all.

But where does this date come from? Almost all imported retail beer is pasteurized. The reason for pasteurizing the beer is from a business standpoint. It basically allows the beer to last longer and be shipped at room temperature (this applies to kegs, cans, and bottles). 

An alternative to the pasteurization process is bottle conditioning. Most domestic beers follow this path. Essentially this process involves beers being sterile filtered and chilled to the point that any surviving bacteria, which could ferment the beer, become dormant.

So basically the probability that the beer begins to ferment is higher over time. A canned beer and a keg beer can taste the same if they both left the brewery at the same time, and both experienced the same conditions during the time it took them to reach you. It is just that kegs have a better chance of taking less time and of being better preserved.

From a practical standpoint though, bottles can cause broken glass, kegs weigh close to 50 lbs. full, and cans allow for shotgunning. Make sure your container of choice fits your environment :)', 303);

I think that the real difference is going to be between keg beer and can/bottle beer.

Canned/bottled beer has a longer shelf life than keg beer. Canned/bottled beer has a shelf life of roughly 45-60 days, whereas a keg is only 25-40 days **<sup>[1](http://www.micromatic.com/beer-questions/how-long-keg-beer-remain-fresh-aid-44.html)</sup>**.

This means that worst case scenario for comparison you could be tasting a 2 month old canned beer versus a 3 week old draft. It can cause a difference in taste, there is a "freshness date" after all. (See this *[excellent answer from @mdma for more information on what happens as beer ages](http://beer.stackexchange.com/a/502/303)*)

But where does this date come from? Almost all imported retail beer is pasteurized. The reason for pasteurizing the beer is from a business standpoint. It basically allows the beer to last longer and be shipped at room temperature (this applies to kegs, cans, and bottles). 

An alternative to the pasteurization process is bottle conditioning. Most domestic beers follow this path. Essentially this process involves beers being sterile filtered and chilled to the point that any surviving bacteria, which could ferment the beer, become dormant **<sup>[2](http://www.micromatic.com/beer-questions/pasteurized-and-non-pasteurized-keg-beer-aid-45.html)</sup>**.

So basically the probability that the beer begins to ferment is higher over time. A canned beer and a keg beer can taste the same if they both left the brewery at the same time, and both experienced the same conditions during the time it took them to reach you. It is just that kegs have a better chance of taking less time and of being better preserved.

From a practical standpoint though, bottles can cause broken glass, kegs weigh close to 50 lbs. full, and cans allow for shotgunning. Make sure your container of choice fits your environment :)

To fully experience the flavor of beer, one must swallow it. This is because, unlike the vast majority of wine, beer is carbonated (albeit to varying degrees). When you swallow beer, some of the carbonation escapes the liquid as gas, and actually rises up from your throat into your nose (or, at least, into your nasal passages), carrying with it some of the flavor molecules of the beer. Thus your sense of smell combines with your sense of taste to produce an overall sense of flavor in a manner that is different from what occurs when you drink (uncarbonated) wine.

If you spit out your beer, you''re ruining the experience.

(This explanation is based on one that I heard years ago from a brewmaster at Anheuser-Busch. I can''t remember his exact words, but you get the gist.)

On a side note, regarding the important relationship between taste and smell, I''m sure you will see tasters at both beer tastings and especially wine tastings swirl their drink a bit to smell it from the glass before tasting it. The difference is that carbonated beverages pack a smell double-whammy coming at you after you swallow.', 396);

If you wanted to increase the electrolyte level, you could experiment with adding small amounts (e.g. 1/8tsp) of these salts, since they also have an effect on the taste of the beer (so makes for an interesting taste experiment!):

 - Calcium Chloride (CaCl) - rounds out and softens the beer emphasizing the malt
 - Calcium Sulphate (CaSO<sub>4</sub>) - makes the hop bitterness crisper 

However, eating some commonly available [foods][2] is even more effective at replenishing electrolyte levels, simply because they contain so many, and is better for you than the typical sports drink that contains a lot of sugar to cover the taste of the salts. 

Also keep in mind, that beer is a diuretic, so you should drink water prior to and after drinking beer to avoid further dehydration after your exercise.

To expand on this a little, here is a really quick guide:

- If it''s from the mid 70s or so on, it''s probably not that valuable.  Exceptions sometimes include aluminum cans, cans with [punch tops](http://imgs.inkfrog.com/pix/UncleDearest/Vintage_Miller_High_Life_1956_Flat_Top_Beer_Can.jpg), and cans with [cone tops](http://www.beercansrus.com/mcart/images/reischcone1.jpg).
- If it''s in poor condition, it''s probably not worth much unless it''s quite rare.  Unless it''s better than "grade 2" (defined as "Has a clean label, but there may be rust or other blemishes near the seam, the lid, or the bottom. Colors may be irregular"), it''s probably not valuable.
- American OIs (opening instructions, named after the instructions that came with them on how to open them) can be worth $35 to $1000.  Most others before the 70s will have a chance of being between $10 and $500, depending on their rarity.', 80);

After around 50 or 60 glasses, there was no statistical evidence whatsoever that any of the three could be identified, or tasted better.

From my personal experience though, I always think that a keg  is better than a bottle is better than a can. But why is that so? I only have the theory that due to the feeling of the container you drink from, your taste is altered (just like food with the same flavour/taste somehow tastes different, with a different texture). Additionally I think the amount of beer that flows into your mouth is different, as well as maybe the turbulence, causing a different amount of carbon dioxide (or nitrogen, depending on your beer culture) to leave the beer before you can actually taste and swallow (which again changes the texture).', 407);

United States of America:

There are also two aspiring Trappist breweries, one in the US named St. Joseph’s Abbey and another in the Netherlands called Abdij Maria Toevlucht. 

There are some strict rules to obtain "Authentic Trappiste Product":

 1. The beer must be brewed within the walls of a Trappist monastery,
    either by the monks themselves or under their supervision.
 2. The brewery must be of secondary importance within the monastery and
    it should witness to the business practices proper to a monastic way
    of life
 3. The brewery is not intended to be a profit-making venture.  The
    income covers the living expenses of the monks and the maintenance
    of the buildings and grounds.  Whatever remains is donated to
    charity for social work and to help persons in need.

There are some standardized naming conventions, for instance the Double (orginally used by Westmalle) is a brown ale which has an alcohol level of around 7%. 

The Tripple is another name first used by Westmalle, which are often blond and have an alcohol level of about 8% to 10%.

While it''s hard to predict the future, we can infer from the past.  As it stands, beer cans as old as 40 years are pretty much worthless (with a few exceptions).  This is because right around the mid 70s, beer can collection as an activity exploded.  Beer cans before that point became valuable, but beer cans from after that point were heavily collected (up through the present day), and are therefore pretty low value.

TLDR: There exist too many well-preserved beer cans from the current era for them to be worth anything in the next 20 years at least (and probably well through the next 40-60 years).

That''s just the cans, though.  Exceptions might be very specific beers known to be age-able for decades.  Unfortunately, most beers just don''t age that long.  Even a hearty barely wine usually peaks, at most, after a couple years.  The Stone Vertical Epic 020202 series was meant to be aged 10 years, which is unusually long for a beer.

If you could find a beer you reasonably believed would improve over the course of several decades, you might be able to get some money out of it if it were stored properly.', 80);

As glass is an insulator and aluminium is a conductor, you''d expect the can to be more efficient at transferring heat from your hand and the environment into the beer.  So a glass bottle should keep the within the optimum temperature range for longer than the can.

This result is backed up by some [research done by students at Worcester Polytechnic Institute][1], which compared the rate at which refrigerated liquid warms up to room temperature in glass and aluminium bottles.  The heating rate differences should be even more noticeable if the bottles were in contact with a body temperature heat source.

This effect can be minimised by insulating the can using a stubby holder/beer cozy.  In another experiment [comparing cans held in a person''s hand][2], over a 30 minute period an uninsulated can rose in temperature by about 14°C while the insulated can rose only 3°C.

Only certains beers are suited for aging, such as some lambics, saisons, Belgian quads, and high ABV stouts and barleywines, to name a few.  Even for some of these it may be noted to cellar for no more than 3-5 years.

For long term aging you also need to maintain temperatures in the range of 55°F.  This temperature should be held consistently with any major swings up or down being avoided.

Outside of this you would need to have beers that are rare and highly sought after today to have even a chance of them being valuable in the future.  Even if you picked out 20 of the most sought after beers today it''s important to remember tastes change and they may not be sought after in 20 years.  Just look at the changes the American craft beer environment has gone through in 20 years!', 263);

If the beer is bottle-conditioned, a small amount of sugar is added deliberately in order to carbonate the beer. Once the yeast have eaten all the sugar, they stop producing carbon dioxide and fall to the bottom of the bottle. This is not physiologically harmful in any way, but the beer might need to be poured carefully to avoid too much yeast in the glass.

(If the beer is force-carbonated at the brewery, the yeast may contribute to the flavor of the beer, but does not produce any CO<sub>2</sub>.)

Harpoon''s UFO appears to be bottle-conditioned, meaning the carbonation is produced naturally by the yeast. It''s a hefeweizen, where the yeast character is actually desired - most people recommend to pour half the bottle, swirl it to suspend the remaining yeast, and then pour the rest.

And PS: the Guinness meat story because of finding rats in the fermentation tanks or barrels is a myth. Or to put it another way, even if it did ever did happen once, it''s not practiced now. It''s hard enough for bacteria to get into the fermentation tanks or barrels, let alone something as big as a rat! (Nowadays they use stainless or aluminum kegs.)

If this definition seems to rule out some rather important airports, we can modify the rules.

This list would really help me with "tiebreaking" when I can''t decide what flights I''d rather take :-)

If anyone else travels frequently too, why don''t we help each other out and compile (community wiki-style) a list of establishments in major airports that serve local beers?

For definition''s sake, though arbitrary, let''s say a "major airport" is one which

 - serves more than [5,000,000+ passengers per year](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_airports_in_the_United_States) ("enplanements"),
 - or serves the _most_ passengers per year in its country.

So, outside of the U.S., check the airport''s Wikipedia page for the stats—for example [Berlin''s Schönefeld Airport](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sch%C3%B6nefeld_International_Airport), with 7,000,000+ enplanements in 2010. Also eligible are airports like [Luxembourg''s main airport](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxembourg-Findel_International_Airport), serving less than 5,000,000 passengers per year, but the most in its country. If this definition seems to rule out some rather important airports, we can modify the rules.

This list would really help me with "tiebreaking" when I can''t decide what flights I''d rather take. It would also give me a reason to enjoy longer-than-desired connections :-)

There was a law enacted in Germany in the 1400''s concerning purity of beer, known as Reinheitsgebot.

In 2003, the EC discussed requiring labeling for Isinglass as a potential food allergen.

The brewers in the EC successfully argued that it was part of the processing and not an additive and thus did not require labeling. 

> Isinglass finings are a tried and tested method of clarifying beer and so it came as a great relief to traditional cask ale brewers when the EC, last year, introduced an amendment to the 2003 labelling directive. The brewing industry successfully argued that as a processing aid, not an ingredient that would be consumed, and with a long history of use with no recorded incidents of an allergic reaction, there was a good case for isinglass to be exempt from the directive.

> Fish and fish products, except for isinglass derived from swim bladders and used as a clarifying agent in beer and wine

The report from FSANZ also included a survey of international laws regarding isinglass.  In addition to the USA and EU that have been covered by other questions, it mentions:

 * Health Canada amended its food labelling requirements in September 2004 such that fining agents derived from fish, milk and egg, used during the manufacture of standardised alcoholic beverages, would be exempt from the allergen labelling requirements.

 * In Japan, Fish is not included on the list of allergens requiring mandatory labelling, with only certain fish species being recommended for labelling.  However, alcohol beverages and related products are not subject to the allergen labelling requirements, so wouldn''t be covered anyway.

 * The [Codex Alimentarius][3] General Standard for the Labelling of Pre-packaged Foods ([Codex Stan 1-1985][4]) requires the declaration of fish products used as ingredients or food additive, and makes no mention of an exemption for isinglass.  In countries that have adopted this standard without making any modifications and apply it to alcoholic beverages, use of isinglass would presumably have to be declared.

So I''d be surprised if many of the ex-soviet brewers didn''t use honey as an additive to their beer. Especially if the beers you have in mind are bottle conditioned, they would need to add a sweetener of sorts for proper carbonation. I''ve used honey in two of my home brews and I like it.

This is not a very restrictive definition and would seem to also apply to whisky if you add some hops to it. So, is there a better one? Preferably one that also excludes ales?

> Snake Venom is the world’s strongest beer as of 24 October 2013, coming in at 67.5%. It is dark amber in colour with no carbonation due to the high ABV. Unlike the previous Armageddon, the alcohol is not masked in Snake Venom. It is highly present yet it still tastes like a beer with a good degree of hop profile. Each batch is tested by the brewery before bottling and random batches are tested externally.

An alcohol content of 67.5% is not something I would associate with beer. So, why is this considered one and not a spirit?

Dictionary.com [defines][2] beer as

> an alcoholic beverage made by brewing and fermentation from cereals, usually malted barley, and flavored with hops and the like for a slightly bitter taste.

This is not a very restrictive definition and would seem to also apply to whisky if you add some hops to it. So, is there a better one?

With that said, I could probably shoot an email to the professor who I took the class with if you want more info, but I think my answer will suffice (but please let me know, he is a pretty cool guy).

Anyway, I would presume it has something to do with Russian culture and the importance of honey in that part of the world. I remember when I was a kid (like 2nd  grade I think), we read a collection of short, non-fiction stories of a Russian girl and her grandfather, who was a beekeeper. I cannot remember what the name of the book was nor the author nor whether or not the stories took before or during the Soviet era; but I do remember that honey played a really important role in most of the stories.  

Of course there is other more concrete evidence other than my childhood reading material. For instance, just take a look at Russian cuisine. They have a mead-like beverage called [Medovukha][1], which is made with honey and yeast. It''s apparently a traditional drink at weddings over there. Also, you''ve got Russian honey cakes and [other food based items][2]. Finally, honey is also a good preservative as it''s antibacterial, so it was often mixed in with jams back in the day to preserve them. 

So I''d be surprised if many of the ex-soviet brewers didn''t use honey as an additive to their beer. Especially if the beers you have in mind are bottle conditioned, they would need to add a sweetener of sorts for proper carbonation. I''ve used honey in two of my home brews and I like it.

---

Perhaps some substantiating points:

 - Some Russian Imperial Stouts (presumably attempts to recreate the traditional Russian counterpart, even if brewed elsewhere) _are_ actually brewed with honey. For example, [3 Floyds'' Dark Lord Russian Imperial Stout](http://downtownbarandgrill.com/?p=533) (as well as [attempts to imitate it](http://www.homebrewtalk.com/f12/dark-lord-cloning-massive-beer-89222/)) and [Alaskan''s Perseverance Ale](http://www.alaskanbeer.com/our-brew/limited-edition/pilot-series/perseverance-ale.html).
 - Baltika Medovoe Light seems to be a popular "first Russian beer" to try. It''s a pale lager with natural honey added.
 - Indeed honey does seem to have played a central role in Russian culture.
 > Like the Assumption, the three "Saviors" (_Spas_), August 1, 6, and 16, were associated with the fruits of the earth. The first was called the "Honey" (_medovyi_) or "Wet Savior" (_mokryi Spas_), signifying either the gathering of honey or the religious procession and blessing of the waters traditional for this day.

 <sup>[Ivanits, L. "Russian Folk Belief." [http://books.google.com]](http://books.google.com/books?id=-s36xYcqG1EC).</sup>

 > According to Russian historian Vasili Kliuchevskii (1841–1911), we must learn about the Russian forest, river and steppe in order to understand the Russian people. [...] "The forest provided the Russian with oak and pine to build his house, it warmed him with aspen and birch, it lit his hut with birchwood splinters, it shod him in birch bast sandals, it gave him plates and dishes, clothed him in hides and furs and fed him honey. The forest was the best shelter from his enemies."

 <sup>[Riordan, J. "Russian Fairy Tales and Their Collectors." [http://books.google.com]](http://books.google.com/books?id=EDvKpNzNBD0C)</sup>

 It''s notable how closely intertwined honey and their ideals of paradise were, as found by a search for the term "honey" in ["The Paradise Myth in Eighteenth-century Russia: Utopian Patterns in Early Secular Russian Literature and Culture"](http://books.google.com/books?id=C46rAAAAIAAJ&q=honey#v=snippet&q=honey&f=false) (Baehr, S. L.).

So, though still conjecture, it may be so that Russian culture has had a higher demand for honey notes in their foods and beverages, naturally selecting those tastes.

Frankly, it may simply be the case that there''s not an objective ("provable") answer to this question.

Some beers, such as real ale (or cask ale) are served at cellar temperature, which while certainly above the temperature of a beer fresh out a refrigerator, at 12-14 degrees celsius (53-57F) is still much colder than room temperature.  

**To answer your question:**  Mulled beer **is** heated beer.  As with wine, mulled beer is usually warmed over a low stove or in a crockpot with spices, often including cinnamon, nutmeg, citrus zest, and a sweetener like brown sugar, but it doesn''t *need* to include any additional ingredients, particularly if it already has strong spice or fruit characteristics.  So, any beer style that you heat is, in fact, mulled beer.     

As to styles of beer that would be suitable for mulling, Belgian Strong Dark ales would be good candidates, as would nice fruity lambics.   Barleywine ales, milk stouts, chocolate stouts, and oatmeal stouts I would imagine might also be nice.  The characteristics I''d look for would be a heavy body, more malty than hoppy, a bit of sweetness, and if present, dark fruit (plumbs, figs, raisins) or berries.

Part of it depends on what you''re used to.  If you''re used to mass-market beers you will find these very different.  Heavier and more substantial.  Richer, more luxurious.  Very much not something you quaff down a few at a time to quench your thirst; these are savored.

The name was used to indicate the strength of the Westmalle beers. Originally there was the Enkel, Dubbel and Tripel. It is said that they represent the holy trinity. Later quadruppels were added. Both Dubbel and Tripel as name were first used by the Trappist brewery of Westmalle.

Westmalle produced the first dark beer in 1856 named "Dubbel" (the recipe was changed in 1926). Dubbels are dark in color, and tend to have malt flavors dominating over hops. Whereas the Quadrupels have more of a fruit presence, the Dubbels tend to be a bit spicier with strong caramel flavors. They tend to have an ABV of 6.5-9.0%.

Some examples:

 - Chimay Red
 - La Trappe Dubbel
 - Ommegang
 - Westvleteren 8 
 - Rochefort 6
 - Westmalle Dubbel

Tripels are lighter color, often blonde. They are generally a lot fruitier and lighter in flavor. The name Tripel originally was first used in 1956 by the Westmalle brewery to name their strongest beer (originally produced in 1930 and named Superbier, it was renamed to Tripel). The ABV is a lot higher than the double,  8.0-12.0%.

Before the discovery/invention of force carbonation methods, all beer was carbonated naturally via bottle or cask conditioning. But people were brewing alcoholic beverages commonly referred to as beer in antiquity, and evidence from these cultures (ancient China, Neolithic culture, etc) suggests that they were doing this in big clay pots and jugs, which may have had no lids or loose lids. Their vessels probably could not have withstood the pressure of carbonation even if they were using wax or cork to seal the vessels.

So if you were to brew a historical style and you wanted to be truly accurate, then you would not carbonate it. But the modern historical interpretations usually are carbonated (like [Dogfish Head''s ancient ales][1]), because they are selling them and Westerners generally prefer them :)

As the other answers indicate, there are no "modern styles" (e.g. [styles you''d find in the BJCP style guide][2]), that have [no carbonation][3], but several have little or low carbonation, (e.g. barleywine) mentioned in other answers. [Sahti][4] also has very little carbonation.

But people do still drink flat/still beer all over the world, for example there''s some uncarbonated corn beers that are popular, like [chicha][5] in Latin America ([Dogfish Head made a Chicha inspired beer][6]) and [umqombothi][7] in South Africa. There are other names for similar beers in other regions. These are typically homebrewed.

Before the discovery/invention of force carbonation methods, all beer was carbonated naturally via bottle or cask conditioning. But people were brewing alcoholic beverages commonly referred to as beer in antiquity, and [evidence][1] from these cultures ([ancient China][2], Neolithic culture, etc) suggests that they were doing this in big stone and earthenware pots and jugs, which may have had no lids or loose lids. Their vessels probably could not have withstood the pressure of carbonation even if they were using wax or cork to seal the vessels.

So if you were to brew a historical style and you wanted to be truly accurate, then you would not carbonate it. But the modern historical interpretations usually are carbonated (like [Dogfish Head''s ancient ales][3]), because they are selling them and Westerners generally prefer them :)

As the other answers indicate, there are no "modern styles" (e.g. [styles you''d find in the BJCP style guide][4]), that have [no carbonation][5], but several have little or low carbonation, (e.g. barleywine) mentioned in other answers. [Sahti][6] also has very little carbonation.

But people do still drink flat/still beer all over the world, for example there''s some uncarbonated corn beers that are popular, like [chicha][7] in Latin America ([Dogfish Head made a Chicha inspired beer][8]) and [umqombothi][9] in South Africa. There are other names for similar beers in other regions. These are typically homebrewed.

But..

On bottles and cans it most often means "Like-Draft", or the marketing department''s way of telling you this beer tastes more like the version of our beer that you get when you go to bar and get off the tap, but in the comfort of your own home.  

For a beer like Guinness or Boddingtons, this means a widget to hold high pressure Nitrogen gas to simulate the effects of a "Beer Gas" pouring system which uses a high pressure mixture of Nitrogen and CO2.  Guinness has actually replaced the widget in some of their "draught" packages as well, I believe the draught bottles.

But for a beer like Miller Genuine Draft, or the other Japanese beers you''re mentioning, it just means the beer is unpasteurized which gives it a flavor more like what you get from a fresh, unpasteurized keg rather than a pasteurized and/or filtered bottled beer.  This is in line with the meaning of "nama" as you mentioned, as the beer is more "fresh" than traditional bottled beer.', 268);

Beer flavor changes over time (hops fade away, oxidation takes hold, etc.), and this process happens more quickly at warmer temperatures than colder ones. But there are no additional chemical reactions caused by temperature changes, so warming to room temperature and re-chilling multiple times is not going to have any added effects on the beer. Assuming you are drinking it within a few weeks, you won''t notice the difference with bottled or canned beer.

I think this myth took hold from left-over kegs after parties: A half-empty keg that was dispensed by pumping air into it will start to oxidize much more quickly since oxygen is being added to it. When it warms the oxidation speeds up and it tastes stale within a day or two. Keeping it cold slows that down a bit, but even cold it won''t last very long. A keg being dispensed using CO2 is a different story: that will last as long as bottled beer and can be warmed and rechilled without ill effects.

In all of this, I am referring to room temperature. Beer left in a car in the sun for hours will start to stale much more quickly, even if bottles are protected from the sunlight. You won''t get the skunky flavor caused by the light, but it will taste stale.', 381);

- all raw materials are brought to the top of the tower, and then each movement of materials or fluids is carried out using gravity - not pumps

My question is: does this provide a difference in flavour, texture or other qualities to beers from those breweries that use pumps? I can imagine it might, as pumps cause agitation that won''t exist in a simple pipe letting liquid flow downhill.

Most just work it out from the hops they add using hop bitterness [calculators][1], rather than it being an actual measurement of the bittering compounds in the beer. For highly hopped beers, the calculated IBUs can be far off compared to reality - above around 100 IBUs it becomes more and more difficult to increase the IBUs of the beer.

The [isomerized alpha acids][2] that give the bitterness are only marginally soluble in wort (they are hydrophobic), and their solubility decreases as more is dissolved: solubility decreases with lower pH and dissolving the iso-acids lowers the pH, so solubility is self-limiting. 

Thus, labels with over 100 IBUs should not be considered accurate, unless the brewer has specifically measured the IBUs in the beer, rather than guessed them from the hop regime.

@audiFanatic, In this case, Beer Advocate is wrong in their description of a Triples.  Triples do NOT use 3x''s the malt as a Single.  No brewer will tell you that, nor is it true historically.  Malt extraction is linear, meaning 3x''s the malt will be 3x''s the alcohol.  The closest you get to that is historically when the single was the 3rd running (like a small beer). With this method, the 1st run had triple the fermentables extracted than the 3rd run.

And while I may only be a blogger, with 13 years of industry experience, I spoke with highly trained brewmasters and read references written by authoritative experts.  I''m pretty sure my answer article is more accurate than the Beer Advocate''s, in this case.  Also, the flavor profile of a triple does not have "flavors similar" to a dubbel.  Dark malt and light malt will give very different flavors. The only Triple that has similar flavor is Stift Engelzell''s triple, which is a unique dark triple, as they''re labeling it.

As such, the distinguishing factor is bitterness.  :)

Since hops are the primary contributor to bitterness in beer, high IBU beers also tend to be hoppy (although that''s not always the case, since hops added at certain points in the brewing process contribute mostly to bitterness, while hops added at other points contribute mostly to hop aroma and flavor).

As an aside, heavier beers (specifically, those with lots of malt) will taste less bitter than a lighter beer with the same IBU.  To elaborate:

> there is still the complication that IBUs do not really correlate with perceived bitterness because other aspects of beer affect the perception of bitterness. For example, two beers containing 25 IBUs will be perceived very different with respect to bitterness if one beer had an O.G. of 10 °Plato and finished at 1.5 °Plato and the other beer had an O.G. of 12.5 °Plato and finished at 2.5 °Plato. Begin varying the malt bill by adding crystal malt, for example, and changing the content of various water salts and things become even muddier. This is the reason that measures like the IBU are extremely useful when used within a population of similar beers, but not so handy when looking at very different populations.

> The origins of the yard of ale date back to the early 17th century, during the reign of King James I (1603-1625). Glass-making in England was then in its infancy; the first glass-making factory had only recently been established. Many of the first yard glasses have not survived due to their brittle nature, until George Ravenscroft (1674) introduced a new glass process known as the flint glass.

>The yard of ale was made and used not for normal drinking purposes, but for feast and manly displays of prowess. During Anglo-Saxon times through the Middle Ages, the English nation has always engaged in the traditions of heavy drinking. As put in Young’s quote “England’s Bane” written in 1617, “He is a man of no fashion that can not drink by the dozen, by the yard, so by measure we drink out of measure.”

>Legend suggests that the yard was also used in old England to serve the driver of a coach. Upon arriving at their destination and relieving its passengers, the coachman would stay and the length of the yard glass would allow him some refreshment.

Some of the same information is repeated in [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yard_of_ale).  

I''m certain that most of the history of using this style of vessel comes from fellow drinkers trying to show each other up at parties, but aside from the sheer volume (and perhaps limitations of glass-making artisans), how did this length and volume of the glass first come about?  Is there more definitive evidence for the year of birth of the yard, besides the milestone in their history of the introduction of flint glass? 

I''m also curious about whether the volume of the glass was satisfying to stagecoach drivers because of their need to wait long periods for their passenger, or whether it was just easier to hand them a tall glass as they remained in the seat. ', 121);

The author also makes an interesting point; a coach driver was almost certainly *not* handed a yard of ale from the alehouse window, because the risk of breaking the glass (which would have been expensive) was too great!

With that said, I could probably shoot an email to the professor who I took the class with if you want more info, but I think my answer will suffice (but please let me know, he is a pretty cool guy).

Anyway, I would presume it has something to do with Russian culture and the importance of honey in that part of the world. I remember when I was a kid (like 2nd  grade I think), we read a collection of short, non-fiction stories of a Russian girl and her grandfather, who was a beekeeper. I cannot remember what the name of the book was nor the author nor whether or not the stories took before or during the Soviet era; but I do remember that honey played a really important role in most of the stories.  

Of course there is other more concrete evidence other than my childhood reading material. For instance, just take a look at Russian cuisine. They have a mead-like beverage called [Medovukha][1], which is made with honey and yeast. It''s apparently a traditional drink at weddings over there. Also, you''ve got Russian honey cakes and [other food based items][2]. Finally, honey is also a good preservative as it''s antibacterial, so it was often mixed in with jams back in the day to preserve them. 

So I''d be surprised if many of the ex-soviet brewers didn''t use honey as an additive to their beer. Especially if the beers you have in mind are bottle conditioned, they would need to add a sweetener of sorts for proper carbonation. I''ve used honey in two of my home brews and I like it.

To summarize, lambics are exposed to wild yeast (rather than the usual cultivated yeasts) and tend to have a dry, tart taste.  These are not heavy-bodied beers, nor are they bitter.  (Hops are used for their preservative effect, but old, dry hops are used to minimize the flavor impact.)

Frequently, lambics (like the one you had) have fruit added later in fermentation.  Common fruits for this include raspberry, peach, and cherry, and I''ve also encountered apple.  The sweetness you''re tasting probably comes from the fruit (and some of these varieties taste sweeter to me than others).  If you''d like to try a lambic that doesn''t have the fruit, which is likely to be less sweet, look for "gueuze".

In Belgium it''s not a style. It''s merely a label to mark that more ingredient were used, comparatively with the other beers within the same brewery.
A little history:
The ingredients to make beer were expensive in the middle ages, so the brewers tried to use as little as possible for there beer. There was however also an market for more tasteful, more expensive, beer. To differentiate between the brewed barrels they used X for the cheap bear, XX for the expensive one. Not saying that there were double the ingredients in it, just more. Later came also XXX. You can still find these X''s on some labels these days.
The name Triple is a more recent appellation (1930''s), but it is based on the same idea.
A classic trio you find in Belgium, but with a lot of exceptions, is a blond(X), a brown (XX, double) and a strong blond ale (XXX, triple). These are relative references, within the brewery and like already mentioned, more ingredients, not doubling or tripling the amount of ingredients. Making the beers stronger in alcohol and taste.

With that said, I could probably shoot an email to the professor who I took the class with if you want more info, but I think my answer will suffice (but please let me know, he is a pretty cool guy).

Anyway, I would presume it has something to do with Russian culture and the importance of honey in that part of the world. I remember when I was a kid (like 2nd  grade I think), we read a collection of short, non-fiction stories of a Russian girl and her grandfather, who was a beekeeper. I cannot remember what the name of the book was nor the author nor whether or not the stories took before or during the Soviet era; but I do remember that honey played a really important role in most of the stories.  

Of course there is other more concrete evidence other than my childhood reading material. For instance, just take a look at Russian cuisine. They have a mead-like beverage called [Medovukha][1], which is made with honey and yeast. It''s apparently a traditional drink at weddings over there. Also, you''ve got Russian honey cakes and [other food based items][2]. Finally, honey is also a good preservative as it''s antibacterial, so it was often mixed in with jams back in the day to preserve them. 

So I''d be surprised if many of the ex-soviet brewers didn''t use honey as an additive to their beer. Especially if the beers you have in mind are bottle conditioned, they would need to add a sweetener of sorts for proper carbonation. I''ve used honey in two of my home brews and I like it.

---

Perhaps some substantiating points:

 - Baltika Medovoe Light seems to be a popular "first Russian beer" to try. It''s a pale lager with natural honey added.
 - Indeed honey does seem to have played a central role in Russian culture.
 > Like the Assumption, the three "Saviors" (_Spas_), August 1, 6, and 16, were associated with the fruits of the earth. The first was called the "Honey" (_medovyi_) or "Wet Savior" (_mokryi Spas_), signifying either the gathering of honey or the religious procession and blessing of the waters traditional for this day.

 <sup>[Ivanits, L. "Russian Folk Belief." [http://books.google.com]](http://books.google.com/books?id=-s36xYcqG1EC).</sup>

 > According to Russian historian Vasili Kliuchevskii (1841–1911), we must learn about the Russian forest, river and steppe in order to understand the Russian people. [...] "The forest provided the Russian with oak and pine to build his house, it warmed him with aspen and birch, it lit his hut with birchwood splinters, it shod him in birch bast sandals, it gave him plates and dishes, clothed him in hides and furs and fed him honey. The forest was the best shelter from his enemies."

 <sup>[Riordan, J. "Russian Fairy Tales and Their Collectors." [http://books.google.com]](http://books.google.com/books?id=EDvKpNzNBD0C)</sup>

 It''s notable how closely intertwined honey and their ideals of paradise were, as found by a search for the term "honey" in ["The Paradise Myth in Eighteenth-century Russia: Utopian Patterns in Early Secular Russian Literature and Culture"](http://books.google.com/books?id=C46rAAAAIAAJ&q=honey#v=snippet&q=honey&f=false) (Baehr, S. L.).

So, though still conjecture, it may be so that Russian culture has had a higher demand for honey notes in their foods and beverages, naturally selecting those tastes.

Frankly, it may simply be the case that there''s not an objective ("provable") answer to this question.

It turns up in regular lager beers as well as darker things. It also turns up in former soviet EU countries that are not very russian and have their beer tradition rather from germany.

See more [here](http://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/36179/472).

The KAA page notes that major import brands (but not boutique breweries) that contain no additives are kosher/pareve even without certification (other than NZ, as previously discussed).  This must mean that NZ is unique in either using whey to produce ethanol or using ethanol to fortify beer, but I don''t know which and didn''t pursue that question with KAA.

 - serves more than [5,000,000+ passengers per year](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_airports_in_the_United_States) ("enplanements"),
 - or serves the _most_ passengers per year in its country.

So, outside of the U.S., check the airport''s Wikipedia page for the stats—for example [Berlin''s Schönefeld Airport](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sch%C3%B6nefeld_International_Airport), with 7,000,000+ enplanements in 2010. Also eligible are airports like [Luxembourg''s main airport](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxembourg-Findel_International_Airport), serving less than 5,000,000 passengers per year, but the most in its country. If this definition seems to rule out some rather important airports, we can modify the rules.

This list would probably help me with "tiebreaking" when I can''t decide what flights I''d rather take. It would also give me a reason to enjoy longer-than-desired connections :-)

Reading the laws and talking to some people the answer is yes you have to purchase the growler from the brewery.', 529);

The first law in question is the [regulation on labeling][1].  Nothing in there *appears* to prevent brewers from filling any growler, but the standard interpretation from both the ABCC and the brewers is that they believe it makes it illegal for them to fill any growlers other than their own, and that is the policy by which they seem to all operate.  

As for retail establishments, there do seem to be some non-brewery bars that offer growlers, (see Ducali Pizzeria and Bar on [this list][2]) but those may be for on-premise use.  There was a proposal for a bill to allow on-premise / off-premise licensees to do growler fills but as far as I can tell, it died in committee, primarily due to strong opposition from craft brewers who were worried it would cut into their bottle profits.  

> Beyond issues of distribution, the joint legislative committee also heard from industry members interested in allowing both on- and off-premise retailers to fill beer containers up to 64 ounces for take-away and off-site consumption. The bill, sponsored by Representative William Pignatelli, has caused some division in the industry between retailers and small brewers. “We think it would be a disaster for our business by cannibalizing our bottle sales, our only real income source,” says one small Massachusetts brewer. “We for one couldn''t thrive in a situation where the profit on bottled beer transfers from brewery to store or bar.”

I can imagine a beer stew would be epic without the meat but with more vegetables.

Stoverij translated would be "stewed things" or something like that.

This question is about the coriander flavour used in those beers.

The question is about the wheat bear siblings of white beer: Hefeweizen. Are there any hefeweizen that also are coriander-flavoured? To add a more subjective bonus question: are any of those commercially available?

I''ve tried [Googling][2], this mainly seems to lead to brewing recipes or extremely localized experiments. I''ve *assumed* (perhaps incorrectly) most if not all German candidates would be bound by the [Reinheitsgebot][3] and as such will not contain coriander. Finally, I''ve checked some Dutch beers (e.g. "Grolsch Weizen") marketed as "weizen" and the listed ingredients, but so far no dice.

To reiterate the question: **are there any hefeweizen beers with coriander commercially available?**

Radler means cyclist in German.  The way I understand the story is that a small pub owner was besieged one day by a slew of thirsty cyclists and knew that his beer supply wouldn''t hold out, so he cut it by mixing it with some sort of lemon drink he had on hand.  As far as I know this origin story isn''t confirmed and Radler likely grew out of folk attempts to "sessionize" and extend the supply of leftover lager through the summer when lower alcohol and more refreshing drinks were wanted.  According to wikipedia the first printed mention of Radler as a drink was in 1912: http://gutenberg.spiegel.de/buch/4594/20  I believe contemporary Radlers use a lemon-soda sort of drink that''s more like a carbonated lemonade than what we''d think of as soda.

Shandy itself is short for Shandygaff which is a British English term from the mid-1800s referring to beer cut with ginger beer or ginger ale. In fact, the OED still defines it as such while Mariam-Webster has loosened it up and allows for any non-alcoholic drink to be used in place of ginger.

As to their reputation, if you''ll forgive me a little supposition, most commercial shandies are very pale duplications of mixing lemonade (or lemon soda) with a beer yourself.  The first commercial example I saw was Lienenkugel''s and it was abusively sweet.  Sam Adams and The Traveler have fared a little better, but I think a major problem is that to commercially produce a shandy you need to heavily filter and pasteurize the beer and lemonade  to make sure the sugar doesn''t ferment or use a non-fermentable sugar, which would change the taste from fresh beer and fresh lemonade.  At the scale a lot of breweries operate at, it possible some of them aren''t even using real lemonade regardless of sugar type.  Also, while continuously popular in Europe, beer cocktails never caught on or were lost in America and we tend to think of them now as marketing gimmicks by macro-brewers (Bud Light Lime, Bud Chelada, Miller Chill), though as they become more visible, I think they''ll become more accepted.

That said, fresh shandy is incredible, I like using wheat beer.', 268);

As the definition you cited says, beer is the product of fermenting sugar derived from cereal grain which is dissolved in water. So water + grain + yeast = beer. The grain has to undergo a saccharification process where the carbohydrate chains (starches) in the grain are transformed into sugar (glucose, fructose, sucrose, maltose...) which is then converted into alcohol by yeast. Fermentable sugar is extracted from barley through [malting][2] and [mashing][3]. The yeast is generally added to the *wort* (unfermented sugary water) manually by the brewer or wild yeast can fall into the beer from the air. 

Other processes may be involved with fermenting other grains. For example, in sake brewing, [koji][4] (a type of mold) is grown on rice (and soybeans) before fermentation in order to convert starches into fermentable sugars, as rice does not contain the enzymes needed to convert its starches into sugars (note: sake is generally not consider beer, but there are beers made with significant quantities of rice, up to 100% rice beer is possible).

Hops is not a necessary ingredient in beer, and beer was made for thousands of years before people started adding hops to it. 

These strong beers like Snake Venom are generally brewed to this high ABV level through freeze "distillation." This isn''t really distillation, because no heat is involved, so people still call them beers. But this is a concentration process similar to distillation. Alcohol has a lower freezing point than water, so when you freeze beer, you can remove the ice and you''re left with a more concentrated beer. This is the process used in the German eisbock style. The brewers also start with a high ABV beer, using special ingredients (sugar sources other than malt, like table sugar) along with strains of yeast that can tolerate high levels of alcohol and still continue to live and ferment. This process can be somewhat difficult and expensive, so it gets attention. In my opinion it''s a novelty, but I guess people like it, because they sell a lot of it.

German-style lagers are almost exclusively recommended to be served no lower than 6C no higher than 9C, but I often find that the last (and warmest) mouthfuls from a glass actually have the most flavour - but I would always start with the lager cold when possible.

Real ales are a different story. On the continent of Europe there still seems to be a myth that British drink their beer ''luke-warm'', but if served at that temperature most Brits would complain (and maybe continue to drink it while complaining). I believe the phrase ''serve cool'' rather than ''cold'' applies. Some live, bottled beers actually suffer from being too cold. On of my favourites, Black Sheep Ale develops a ''chill haze'' - going a little cloudy if left in the fridge too long. 13C is about right for such beers.

 1. As you suspect, the bowl shaped glass helps to concentrate the aroma.  However, this isn''t unique to the snifter as many types of beer glasses incorporate a narrowing throat to provide this effect. 
 2. Quantity.  With a glass of beer that has a particularly high alcohol content, or particularly strong flavor, you''ll often get much less than a standard 12-16 oz. pour.  The beer you refer to for instance, the Big Bad Baptist, has an alcohol content of 11.8% ABV, which closer to wine than beer, (and wine has a standard 5oz serving size per glass, or thereabouts) so it calls for a smaller serving size.  However, a 5oz or 6oz serving would look rather silly in a pint glass, so a snifter is more appropriate in proportion.

The actual answer has more to do with yeast content than carbonation.  Unfiltered beers like real ale have much more yeast in suspension, and yeast has a tendency to make you gassy when digested.  Lager in general has very little yeast due to the long, cold, aging process.  I believe commercial examples are filtered as well.  In general most commercial beers are filtered, or at least have had the yeast killed off somehow, which mitigates the effect.  Real ale''s major selling points are that it''s unpasteurized and unfiltered, and is refermented in the cask...so it''s basically got way more yeast and way more active yeast than other kinds of beer.

Warming beer – "stauchen" in German –, by placing the bottle in hot water, was common in the southwest of Germany, and althought the practice has fallen out of use in recent years you can still order your beer "gestaucht", i.e. warmed to about 50 to 60°C (122 to 140°F), in traditional restaurants (at no extra price, of course).

Here is an image of one restaurant that uses old hot-water bottles to warm their beer as a gimmick ([source][3]):

The old gardener and his younger colleague claimed that drinking warm beer would keep away any cold that working in the wet and cold outside would otherwise bring on them. We were certainly all very healthy those two winters (and got a lot of snow shovelled), so my question is:

Apples are different because we grow so much more of them than strawberries or plums, and they are regularly pressed into apple juice in large quantities by the fruit grower cooperatives that sell it to the beverage industry. If you don''t pasteurize the juice (for long term stability), it turns alcoholic after a couple of days, and after the apple harvest everyone gets large cannisters of freshly pressed juice from the cooperative presses, bakes onion tarts ("Dinnele"), and eats and drinks this seasonal speciality, with more or less alchohol, depending on taste.

"Most" ([must][7]) or "Süßmost" (sweet must) is freshly pressed juice; once it has turned alcoholic (and sour) it has different names in different areas, such as "Sauermost" (sour must) and [Apfelwein][8] (apple wine).

Within southern Germany and Austria, Frankfurt is not specifically famous for apple wine, the drink, because it is drunk elsewhere, too. What the region around Frankfurt is somewhat well-known for are the festivities surrounding the end of the apple harvest and the pessing of apple juice, which have been the background theme for a musical tv show, [Zum Blauen Bock][9] (The Blue Goat Buck), that ran from 1957 to 1987.

Many kids grew up spending cosy weekend family tv evenings watching that show, and I would guess that this is what makes Apple Wine "famous" (for us), but only in the special Hessian pronunciation "Ebbelwoi".

You can see from the [article about mash ingredients](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mash_ingredients#Black_malt) that black patent malt is "barley malt that has been kilned to the point of carbonizing, around 200 °C."

But in general, this question is a bit too broad. in my opinion. You don''t specify whether or not you''re talking about local beers or just beers in general. There''s a few thousand breweries worldwide; many of them coming out with new releases regularly. Keeping tabs on all of them would be somewhat of a challenge (especially the ones who don''t update their sites regularly ([ahem...if my local friends across the bay are on here, I''m looking at you][3]). So in terms of local beers, Untapped and Beermenus should do what you''re looking for. But At this point in time, I think a global list is infeasible until somebody develops an easy-to-use API which gets some traction in the industry.

If you have a "bottle conditioned" beer -- that is, one in which live yeast are still present -- then under warmer conditions, you potentially have active yeast.

Under cooler conditions, the yeast will be only minimally active.

Regardless of whether your beer is "bottle conditioned" or not, the hop acids present from the brewing process don''t respond favorably to heat or light.

 1. You can call and make an appointment and IF you get an

    up your crate of bier. If you can''t make it at the appointed time

They will not allow you to make 2 appointments with the same license plate number in a 60 day period. Additionally, the phone number you must call to get an appointment is always busy, I have heard of people using automatic redial for hours before they finally get through. 
 2. If you are in the area (again you will need a car, because there is no public transport, and biking there is unreasonable from most places.) You can pop in and there is a small shop next to the monastery where you can buy a 6 pack per person without appointment, and also with out a huge price markup. Of course while you are there you can also eat some good food, and buy other items that the monks make and sell. This is much less hassle, but you cannot get much bier, so it may not be worth trekking all the way out there specifically for this.  However if you are in the area already and you have the time to take a small detour then you should certainly pop in for lunch or dinner and get some tasty brew.
 3. Finally if you are in the Benelux region you can sometimes find Westvleteren in local shops or cafes, however the prices range from 10-16 euros per bottle (in Amsterdam) which is a lot more than you will pay at the monastery.

I''ve tasted some beers that are way off the IBU scale that I linked to, but it''s still subjective to say that these beers are "too hoppy." It''s a matter of taste that I''d compare to saying that some foods are "too spicy." Some people might just like to try these novelty beers once, and other people might really develop a taste for them.

Anyway, what length are the beer lines?  Generally you need to balance CO2 pressure against beer lines to avoid consistently foamy pours.  If your system isn''t properly balanced the beer will always be foamy, on every pour.  I have 5-6 foot lines in my kegerator and it works pretty well for me, when I was having foamy pour problems everyone suggested replacing them with 10 foot lines just to make damn sure the pour wasn''t too violent.  Also making sure the lines are clean.  Any beer stone or other sediment in the lines is going to cause foam.

Serving warmer with lower CO2 would also be a better step.  One frustrating thing about these sorts of adjustments is that it takes time for equilibrium to be hit.  So if you lower the CO2 pressure, the headspace is still pressurize.  You''ll need to vent the keg via the pressure release valve.  Same deal with raising the temperature.  Once the beer actually comes up to the new temp, there will have been CO2 driven out of solution that you need to vent from the headspace via the pressure release valve.  It''s a pain.  Regulators will also often have their own pressure valve, which you should poke and vent slightly when setting the pressure...especially when coming down since excess pressure in the system is going to mess with the reading.  So vent, watch it rise to the actual pressure, then adjust, vent again, and watch.  It takes some time but generally once you set it there''s very little change required.

It''s hard to tell without seeing the speed of your pour.

Definitely check the keg temperature itself.  As a homebrewer I reuse kegs, so I have stickers on all my kegs that have a little temperature line.  These liquid crystal thermometers, like [this one][1], are pretty cheap.

You can also check the ambient temperature using a regular thermometer and a small glass of water.  You should check temperature at multiple spots inside the kegerator, so you could fill some tumblers or shot glasses with water and place them at the bottom of the kegerator, then maybe on top of the keg, and then maybe a back shelf if you have anything like that.  This lets you know if you have any hot spots which you can reduce by reorganizing tubes or tossing a small computer case fan in there.

Also, if you haven''t disabled the dome light in the fridge, do so or find some way to make sure the switch stays down beyond a doubt.  When I first built my kegerator I was getting incredibly foamy pours and a huge contributor wound up being the dome light kept coming on and heating up the tops of the kegs and the beer in my lines.

Another final check is the temperature inside of the tower.  If you have no way for the cold air to get from the body of the fridge into the tower the lines in the tower will get warm and cause foamy beer, though if the CO2 pressure is set correctly, this would likely only result in the first 1-2 pours being foamy, then it calms down until the lines warm back up.  A lot of people will put fans or run copper tubes up the towers.  I filled mine with insulation.

Ignoring the taste of hoppiness, which is different from bitterness (dear Bob that myth needs to die), there''s a limit to how much bitterness we humans can actually perceive.  Past about 100 IBUs the tongue straight up can''t tell that there are any more.  Now we perceive the quality of bitterness differently.

So bitterness in beer is provided primarily by adding hops and boiling them for a long time.  The length of time and pH of the wort affects a chemical reaction called "Isomerization", which is the process by which Alpha Acids in hop oils become Iso-Alpha Acids which stay stably in solution and make beer taste bitter.

Similarly, there are also Beta Acids.  Generally these are in 1:1 ratio with the Alpha acids but sometimes there are more or less depending on the hop types.

Beta Acids are chemically Lupulones and Alpha Acids are Humulones.  We''ve identified 3 types of each as well: No prefix, Co-, and Ad-.  The number usually given on hop packets for home brewers, I believe, is Cohumulone.  But straight IBUs don''t take which acids were used to get to that number.

Humulone is thought to give the best, smoothest, most pleasing bitterness.

Beta acids are also thought of as a "rough" bitterness, but they primarily produce bitterness via oxidation and can help long term shelf-stability.

I don''t know what all this really helps to answer, but I guess the main points are that you can''t taste past 100 IBUs, but there are qualities to bitterness that can make some beers more abusive than others.  Also my final point is that hop flavor and aroma don''t make a beer bitter.  If the hops have been boiled enough to actually make a beer that bitter...you do not taste those hops.  You can have hoppy beers that are smooth and not bitter at all by hop selection, yeast selection, dry hopping, and not boiling them hops very much.

  <p>The profession of scribe was considered to be most honourable, and its rewards were great, for no rank and no dignity were too high for the educated scribe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>E.A. Wallis Budge, <em>The Literature of the Ancient Egyptians</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is impossible to disassociate language from science or science from
  language, because every natural science always involves three things:
  the sequence of phenomena on which the science is based, the abstract
  concepts which call these phenomena to mind, and the words in which
  the concepts are expressed. To call forth a concept, a word is needed;
  to portray a phenomenon, a concept is needed. All three mirror one and
  the same reality.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Antoine Lavoisier, 1789</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[L]ogic, in so far as it exhibits the universal and necessary laws of
  the understanding, must in these very laws present us with criteria of
  truth. Whatever contradicts these rules is false, because thereby the
  understanding is made to contradict its own universal laws of thought;
  that is, to contradict itself.</p>

  If you want to become an expert programmer, google SOLID, buy GOF, buy POEAA, buy Clean Code, learn Refactoring, lookup GRASP, DDD, CQRS, DCI … but dont ask for PHP books. That''s the most reasonable suggestion I can give you when you ask for Expert PHP books really.</p>

OK, i have to rant for a second.  Why is it that of the thousands of posts of PHP/MySQL advice on SO, about 99.5% are still using <code>mysql_query</code> -- and about half of those could be the poster child for SQL injection?</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/mysqlinfo.api.choosing.php" rel="nofollow">The <code>mysql</code> extension is deprecated</a>, and you are a horrible programmer if you continue to use it.  There have been less creaky alternatives for years.  The <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/book.pdo.php" rel="nofollow"><strong>PDO</strong></a> and <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/book.mysqli.php" rel="nofollow"><strong>mysqli</strong></a> extensions are what decent code uses.</li>
<li><p>Both new extensions provide a really cool feature: prepared statements.  Used right, they nearly eliminate SQL injection vulnerabilities with very little effort.</p>

<pre class="lang-php prettyprint-override"><code>$db = new PDO(...);
$stmt = $db-&gt;prepare(''
    SELECT some_stuff
    FROM some_table
    WHERE some_field = ?
'');

# note the '', and how i don''t have to care.
# `execute()` will escape it automagically. 
$stmt-&gt;execute(array("this won''t break"));

while ($row = $stmt-&gt;fetch()) {
    ...
}
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>I don''t want to have to start calling people out on it, but seriously, prepared statements aren''t just safer, they''re freaking <em>easier</em>.  Learn them or quit calling yourself a PHP programmer.</p>

<p>I''m a self-taught programmer (dabbled a bit around 12, but didn''t really get started until two years later) that just wants to get to know more about web development and computers in general - <em>love</em> learning, <em>hate</em> school.  It''s great learning something new on Stack Overflow and other Stack Exchange sites every day.</p>

<p>Currently I''m proficient in the following languages:</p>

<ul>
<li>JavaScript (by far my most common for my answers on Stack Overflow)</li>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
</ul>

<p>I''ve started off learning Python - it''s slightly different to JavaScript but so far it''s been surprisingly easy to use.</p>

<p>I find PHP rather horrid -- it''s just too big of a mess to deal with and I abhor the giant blob of functions.  I wouldn''t even recommend it for a newbie - not only is it rather dissimilar to other languages, you have to spend half your time reading the PHP manual to figure out what a method does, which cuts down on productivity and learning significantly.</p>

<p>Having said that, some of the languages I''m learning now or considering to in the future are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lua</li>
<li>C#</li>
<li>Racket</li>
<li>(and if this doesn''t take a decade) Haskell</li>
</ul>

<p>I''ve moved to HK just recently, originally from Sydney, Australia.</p>
