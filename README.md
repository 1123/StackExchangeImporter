This project allows to import stackexchange dumps into a postgres database. Technologies used are Java, Hibernate and JAXB. Currently only import of posts is possible, but this can be easily extended to comments, badges, votes, etc, since all files have similar relational structure. 

Importing into a relational database is the first step in mining data from the stackexchange sites (most importantly from stackoverflow). I hope this project may be useful to others.
